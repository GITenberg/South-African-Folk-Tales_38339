<h2>SOUTH-AFRICAN<br />
FOLK-TALES</h2>


<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_1" id="Page_1">[1]</a></span></p>
<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>


<p>In presenting these stories, which are of deep
interest and value to South Africans, I
hope they may prove of some value to
those Americans who have either an interest in
animals or who appreciate the folklore of other
countries.</p>

<p>Many of these tales have appeared among
English collections previous to 1880, others
have been translated from the Dutch, and a few
have been written from childhood remembrance.
Consequently they do not pretend to be original
or unique. Care has been taken not to spoil
the ethnological value for the sake of form or
structure; and in all cases they are as nearly
like the original as a translation from one tongue
to another will allow. They are all South-African
folklore tales and mainly from the Bushmen.
Some are perverted types from what were
originally Bushmen tales, but have been taken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
over by Hottentots or Zulus; a few are from the
Dutch. Most of these last named will show a
European influence, especially French.</p>

<p>Some of the animal stories have appeared in
American magazines under the author's name,
but this is the first time that a complete collection
has appeared since Dr. Bleek published his
stories in 1864. The object has been to keep
the stories apart from those which have a mythological
or religious significance, and especially
to keep it an animal collection free from those
in which man appears to take a part.</p>

<p>There will be found several versions of the
same story, and as far as possible these will be
put in the order of their importance in relation
to the original. The author does not pretend to
be an authority on South-African folklore, but
has only a South-African-born interest in what
springs from that country of sunshine. It is a
difficult task to attempt to trace the origin of
these stories, as there is no country where there
have been so many distinct and primitive races
dwelling together.</p>

<p>The Bushmen seem to trace back to the earli<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>est
Egyptian days, when dwarfs were pictured
on the tombs of the kings and were a distinct
race. From then until now it has been their
pride to say that before men were men, they
were; or, to put it clearer, before Africa was
inhabited by other races, they were there. As
represented by some of these stories of the
Bushmen, what races have not, then, had their
influence on the folklore? According to Stow,
they were a wandering primitive race of small
men, painters and sculptors, hunters and herdsmen,
and withal a race showing traces of wonderful
reasoning and adaptability, with a keen
sense of justice and a store of pride. Mythological
some of their stories are, but whether this
is due to the influence of the Hottentots, a later
race, it is difficult to say. And, lastly, there
are the Kaffirs spread over the whole of South
Africa, domineering, but backward. The varied
influences which may have affected these stories
before they reached us show what enormous
possibilities there are for error in tracing the
origin of the animal tales here presented. Bleek
finds that a greater congeniality exists between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
the Hottentot and European mind than is found
between the latter and any other of the black
races of Africa. Whether he means that this
indicates a European origin of the fables, I cannot
say. There is no doubt in my mind that
the Bushmen came from the north and were the
primitive race of south and tropical Africa, the
dwarfs of Livingstone, Stanley, and other explorers.
Considering, then, the great antiquity
of this race, it naturally follows that if these
stories are not original with the Bushmen, they
are at least so modified as to bear no resemblance
to Egyptian, Ph&oelig;nician, or any other ancient
race which the Bushmen may have come in contact
with. Herodotus described a race on the
upper Nile which corresponds with later descriptions
of the Bushmen in tropical and southern
Africa.</p>

<p>I agree with what the <i>South-African Folklore
Journal</i> stated twenty years or more ago, that
with the "vast strides South Africa is making
in the progress of civilization, the native
races will either be swept away or so altered
as to lose many of their ancient habits, cus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>toms,
traditions, or at least greatly to modify
them."</p>

<p>Knowing that by a collection of this kind
these stories could best be preserved, and feeling
that others had not read them, I began this
collection ten years ago. There is so much done
now to preserve what is still Bushmen folklore
that I feel this small volume is indeed only a
small addition to the folklore world.</p>

<p>"South-African folklore is," the <i>South-African
Folklore Journal</i> says, "in its very nature
plain, and primitive in its simplicity; not
adorned with the wealth of palaces and precious
stones to be met with in the folklore of more
civilized nations, but descriptive in great measure
of the events of everyday life, among those
in a low state of civilization; and with the exception
of evidences of moral qualities, and of
such imagery as is connected with the phenomena
of nature, very little that is grand or magnificent
must be looked for in it."</p>

<p>Bain gives a story related by a Kaffir which
shows "the distribution of animals after the
creation." This story could not become typ<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>ically
Kaffir until after the Kaffir came in contact
with the European in the last two or three
hundred years. However, the story will serve
to illustrate the people whose stories appear in
this volume and to close the Introduction.</p>

<p>Teco, in Kaffir, is the Supreme Being. Teco
had every description of stock and property.</p>

<p>There were three nations created, viz., the
Whites, the Amakosa, or Kaffirs, and the Amalouw,
or Hottentots. A day was appointed for
them to appear before the Teco to receive whatever
he might apportion to each tribe. While
they were assembling, a honey bird, or honey
guide, came fluttering by, and all the Hottentots
ran after it, whistling and making the peculiar
noise they generally do while following
this wonderful little bird. The Teco remonstrated
with them about their behavior, but to
no purpose. He thereupon denounced them as
a vagrant race that would have to exist on wild
roots and honey beer, and possess no stock whatever.</p>

<p>When the fine herds of cattle were brought,
the Kaffirs became very much excited&mdash;the one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
exclaiming, "That black and white cow is
mine!" and another, "That red cow and black
bull are mine!" and so on, till at last the Teco,
whose patience had been severely taxed by their
shouts and unruly behavior, denounced them as
a restless people, who would only possess cattle.</p>

<p>The Whites patiently waited until they received
cattle, horses, sheep, and all sorts of
property. Hence, the old Kaffir observed, "You
Whites have got everything. We Kaffirs have
only cattle, while the Amalouw, or Hottentots,
have nothing."</p>

<h2>ORIGIN OF THE DIFFERENCE<br />
IN MODES OF LIFE BETWEEN<br />
HOTTENTOTS AND BUSHMEN</h2>


<p>In the beginning there were two. One was
blind, the other was always hunting. This
hunter found at last a hole in the earth
from which game proceeded and killed the
young. The blind man, feeling and smelling
them, said, "They are not game, but cattle."</p>

<p>The blind man afterwards recovered his sight,
and going with the hunter to this hole, saw
that they were cows with their calves. He then
quickly built a kraal (fence made of thorns)
round them, and anointed himself, just as Hottentots
(in their native state) are still wont
to do.</p>

<p>When the other, who now with great trouble
had to seek his game, came and saw this, he
wanted to anoint himself also. "Look here!"
said the other, "you must throw the ointment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
into the fire, and afterwards use it." He followed
this advice, and the flames flaring up into
his face, burnt him most miserably; so that he
was glad to make his escape. The other, however,
called to him: "Here, take the kirri (a
knobstick), and run to the hills to hunt there
for honey."</p>

<p>Hence sprung the race of Bushmen.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>
<h2>THE LOST MESSAGE</h2>


<p>The ant has had from time immemorial
many enemies, and because he is small
and destructive, there have been a
great many slaughters among them. Not only
were most of the birds their enemies, but Anteater
lived almost wholly from them, and Centipede
beset them every time and at all places
when he had the chance.</p>

<p>So now there were a few among them who
thought it would be well to hold council together
and see if they could not come to some arrangement
whereby they could retreat to some place
of safety when attacked by robber birds and
animals.</p>

<p>But at the gathering their opinions were
most discordant, and they could come to no
decision.</p>

<p>There was Red-ant, Rice-ant, Black-ant,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
Wagtail-ant, Gray-ant, Shining-ant, and many
other varieties. The discussion was a true babel
of diversity, which continued for a long time
and came to nothing.</p>

<p>A part desired that they should all go into
a small hole in the ground, and live there;
another part wanted to have a large and strong
dwelling built on the ground, where nobody
could enter but an ant; still another wanted
to dwell in trees, so as to get rid of Anteater,
forgetting entirely that there they would be the
prey of birds; another part seemed inclined to
have wings and fly.</p>

<p>And, as has already been said, this deliberation
amounted to nothing, and each party resolved
to go to work in its own way, and on
its own responsibility.</p>

<p>Greater unity than that which existed in
each separate faction could be seen nowhere
in the world; each had his appointed task,
each did his work regularly and well. And all
worked together in the same way. From among
them they chose a king&mdash;that is to say some
of the groups did&mdash;and they divided the la<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>bor
so that all went as smoothly as it possibly
could.</p>

<p>But each group did it in its own way, and
not one of them thought of protecting themselves
against the onslaught of birds or Anteater.</p>

<p>The Red-ants built their house on the ground
and lived under it, but Anteater leveled to the
ground in a minute what had cost them many
days of precious labor. The Rice-ants lived under
the ground, and with them it went no better.
For whenever they came out, Anteater visited
them and took them out sack and pack. The
Wagtail-ants fled to the trees, but there on many
occasions sat Centipede waiting for them, or the
birds gobbled them up. The Gray-ants had intended
to save themselves from extermination
by taking to flight, but this also availed them
nothing, because the Lizard, the Hunting-spider,
and the birds went a great deal faster than
they.</p>

<p>When the Insect-king heard that they could
come to no agreement he sent them the secret
of unity, and the message of Work-together.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
But unfortunately he chose for his messenger
the Beetle, and he has never yet arrived at the
Ants, so that they are still to-day the embodiment
of discord and consequently the prey of
enemies.</p>

<h2>THE MONKEY'S FIDDLE</h2>


<p>Hunger and want forced Monkey one
day to forsake his land and to seek
elsewhere among strangers for much-needed
work. Bulbs, earth beans, scorpions, insects,
and such things were completely exhausted
in his own land. But fortunately he received,
for the time being, shelter with a great uncle of
his, Orang Outang, who lived in another part
of the country.</p>

<p>When he had worked for quite a while he
wanted to return home, and as recompense his
great uncle gave him a fiddle and a bow and
arrow and told him that with the bow and arrow
he could hit and kill anything he desired,
and with the fiddle he could force anything to
dance.</p>

<p>The first he met upon his return to his own
land was Brer Wolf. This old fellow told him
all the news and also that he had since early<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
morning been attempting to stalk a deer, but all
in vain.</p>

<p>Then Monkey laid before him all the wonders
of the bow and arrow that he carried on
his back and assured him if he could but see
the deer he would bring it down for him. When
Wolf showed him the deer, Monkey was ready
and down fell the deer.</p>

<p>They made a good meal together, but instead
of Wolf being thankful, jealousy overmastered
him and he begged for the bow and arrow.
When Monkey refused to give it to him, he
thereupon began to threaten him with his greater
strength, and so when Jackal passed by, Wolf
told him that Monkey had stolen his bow and
arrow. After Jackal had heard both of them,
he declared himself unqualified to settle the
case alone, and he proposed that they bring
the matter to the court of Lion, Tiger, and the
other animals. In the meantime he declared he
would take possession of what had been the
cause of their quarrel, so that it would be safe,
as he said. But he immediately brought to
earth all that was eatable, so there was a long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
time of slaughter before Monkey and Wolf
agreed to have the affair in court.</p>

<p>Monkey's evidence was weak, and to make it
worse, Jackal's testimony was against him.
Jackal thought that in this way it would be
easier to obtain the bow and arrow from Wolf
for himself.</p>

<p>And so fell the sentence against Monkey.
Theft was looked upon as a great wrong; he
must hang.</p>

<p>The fiddle was still at his side, and he received
as a last favor from the court the right to play
a tune on it.</p>

<p>He was a master player of his time, and in
addition to this came the wonderful power of
his charmed fiddle. Thus, when he struck the
first note of "Cockcrow" upon it, the court
began at once to show an unusual and spontaneous
liveliness, and before he came to the
first waltzing turn of the old tune the whole
court was dancing like a whirlwind.</p>

<p>Over and over, quicker and quicker, sounded
the tune of "Cockcrow" on the charmed fiddle,
until some of the dancers, exhausted, fell down,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
although still keeping their feet in motion. But
Monkey, musician as he was, heard and saw
nothing of what had happened around him.
With his head placed lovingly against the instrument,
and his eyes half closed, he played
on, keeping time ever with his foot.</p>

<p>Wolf was the first to cry out in pleading tones
breathlessly, "Please stop, Cousin Monkey!
For love's sake, please stop!"</p>

<p>But Monkey did not even hear him. Over and
over sounded the resistless waltz of "Cockcrow."</p>

<p>After a while Lion showed signs of fatigue,
and when he had gone the round once more with
his young lion wife, he growled as he passed
Monkey, "My whole kingdom is yours, ape, if
you just stop playing."</p>

<p>"I do not want it," answered Monkey, "but
withdraw the sentence and give me my bow and
arrow, and you, Wolf, acknowledge that you
stole it from me."</p>

<p>"I acknowledge, I acknowledge!" cried Wolf,
while Lion cried, at the same instant, that he
withdrew the sentence.</p>

<p>Monkey gave them just a few more turns<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
of the "Cockcrow," gathered up his bow and
arrow, and seated himself high up in the nearest
camel thorn tree.</p>

<p>The court and other animals were so afraid
that he might begin again that they hastily disbanded
to new parts of the world.</p>

<h2>THE TIGER, THE RAM, AND<br />
THE JACKAL</h2>


<p>Tiger (leopard) was returning home
from hunting on one occasion, when he
lighted on the kraal of Ram. Now,
Tiger had never seen Ram before, and accordingly,
approaching submissively, he said, "Good
day, friend! What may your name be?"</p>

<p>The other in his gruff voice, and striking his
breast with his forefoot, said, "I am Ram. Who
are you?"</p>

<p>"Tiger," answered the other, more dead than
alive, and then, taking leave of Ram, he ran
home as fast as he could.</p>

<p>Jackal lived at the same place as Tiger did,
and the latter going to him, said, "Friend
Jackal, I am quite out of breath, and am half
dead with fright, for I have just seen a terrible
looking fellow, with a large and thick head, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
on my asking him what his name was, he answered,
'I am Ram.'"</p>

<p>"What a foolish fellow you are," cried
Jackal, "to let such a nice piece of flesh stand!
Why did you do so? But we shall go to-morrow
and eat it together."</p>

<p>Next day the two set off for the kraal of
Ram, and as they appeared over a hill, Ram,
who had turned out to look about him, and was
calculating where he should that day crop a
tender salad, saw them, and he immediately went
to his wife and said, "I fear this is our last day,
for Jackal and Tiger are both coming against
us. What shall we do?"</p>

<p>"Don't be afraid," said the wife, "but take
up the child in your arms, go out with it, and
pinch it to make it cry as if it were hungry."
Ram did so as the confederates came on.</p>

<p>No sooner did Tiger cast his eyes on Ram
than fear again took possession of him, and he
wished to turn back. Jackal had provided
against this, and made Tiger fast to himself
with a leathern thong, and said, "Come on,"
when Ram cried in a loud voice, and pinching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
his child at the same time, "You have done
well, Friend Jackal, to have brought us Tiger
to eat, for you hear how my child is crying for
food."</p>

<p>On these dreadful words Tiger, notwithstanding
the entreaties of Jackal to let him go, to
let him loose, set off in the greatest alarm,
dragged Jackal after him over hill and valley,
through bushes and over rocks, and never
stopped to look behind him till he brought back
himself and half-dead Jackal to his place again.
And so Ram escaped.</p>

<h2>THE JACKAL AND THE WOLF</h2>


<p>Once on a time Jackal, who lived on
the borders of the colony, saw a
wagon returning from the seaside
laden with fish; he tried to get into the wagon
from behind, but he could not; he then ran on
before and lay in the road as if dead. The
wagon came up to him, and the leader cried to
the driver, "Here is a fine kaross for your
wife!"</p>

<p>"Throw it into the wagon," said the driver,
and Jackal was thrown in.</p>

<p>The wagon traveled on, through a moonlight
night, and all the while Jackal was throwing
out the fish into the road; he then jumped out
himself and secured a great prize. But stupid
old Wolf (hyena), coming by, ate more than his
share, for which Jackal owed him a grudge, and
he said to him, "You can get plenty of fish,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
too, if you lie in the way of a wagon as I did,
and keep quite still whatever happens."</p>

<p>"So!" mumbled Wolf.</p>

<p>Accordingly, when the next wagon came from
the sea, Wolf stretched himself out in the road.
"What ugly thing is this?" cried the leader,
and kicked Wolf. He then took a stick and
thrashed him within an inch of his life. Wolf,
according to the directions of Jackal, lay quiet
as long as he could; he then got up and hobbled
off to tell his misfortune to Jackal, who pretended
to comfort him.</p>

<p>"What a pity," said Wolf, "I have not got
such a handsome skin as you have!"</p>

<h2>A JACKAL AND A WOLF</h2>


<p>Jackal and Wolf went and hired themselves
to a man to be his servants. In
the middle of the night Jackal rose and
smeared Wolf's tail with some fat, and then ate
all the rest of it in the house. In the morning
the man missed the fat, and he immediately accused
Jackal of having eaten it. "Look at
Wolf's <a name="tail" id="tail"></a><ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'tale'">tail</ins>," said the rogue, "and you will see
who is the thief." The man did so, and then
thrashed Wolf till he was nearly dead.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>
<h2>THE LION, THE JACKAL, AND<br />
THE MAN</h2>


<p>It so happened one day that Lion and Jackal
came together to converse on affairs of
land and state. Jackal, let me say, was
the most important adviser to the king of the
forest, and after they had spoken about these
matters for quite a while, the conversation took
a more personal turn.</p>

<p>Lion began to boast and talk big about his
strength. Jackal had, perhaps, given him cause
for it, because by nature he was a flatterer. But
now that Lion began to assume so many airs,
said he, "See here, Lion, I will show you an
animal that is still more powerful than you are."</p>

<p>They walked along, Jackal leading the way,
and met first a little boy.</p>

<p>"Is this the strong man?" asked Lion.</p>

<p>"No," answered Jackal, "he must still become
a man, O king."</p>

<p>After a while they found an old man walking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
with bowed head and supporting his bent figure
with a stick.</p>

<p>"Is this the wonderful strong man?" asked
Lion.</p>

<p>"Not yet, O king," was Jackal's answer, "he
has been a man."</p>

<p>Continuing their walk a short distance farther,
they came across a young hunter, in the
prime of youth, and accompanied by some of
his dogs.</p>

<p>"There you have him now, O king," said
Jackal. "Pit your strength against his, and if
you win, then truly you are the strength of
the earth."</p>

<p>Then Jackal made tracks to one side toward
a little rocky kopje from which he would be able
to see the meeting.</p>

<p>Growling, growling, Lion strode forward to
meet the man, but when he came close the dogs
beset him. He, however, paid but little attention
to the dogs, pushed and separated them
on all sides with a few sweeps of his front paws.
They howled aloud, beating a hasty retreat
toward the man.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>Thereupon the man fired a charge of shot,
hitting him behind the shoulder, but even to
this Lion paid but little attention. Thereupon
the hunter pulled out his steel knife, and
gave him a few good jabs. Lion retreated, followed
by the flying bullets of the hunter.</p>

<p>"Well, are you strongest now?" was Jackal's
first question when Lion arrived at his side.</p>

<p>"No, Jackal," answered Lion, "let that fellow
there keep the name and welcome. Such as
he I have never before seen. In the first place he
had about ten of his bodyguard storm me. I
really did not bother myself much about them,
but when I attempted to turn him to chaff,
he spat and blew fire at me, mostly into my
face, that burned just a little but not very
badly. And when I again endeavored to pull
him to the ground he jerked out from his body
one of his ribs with which he gave me some very
ugly wounds, so bad that I had to make chips
fly, and as a parting he sent some warm bullets
after me. No, Jackal, give him the name."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>
<h2>THE WORLD'S REWARD</h2>


<p>Once there was a man that had an old
dog, so old that the man desired to
put him aside. The dog had served
him very faithfully when he was still young,
but ingratitude is the world's reward, and the
man now wanted to dispose of him. The old
dumb creature, however, ferreted out the plan
of his master, and so at once resolved to go away
of his own accord.</p>

<p>After he had walked quite a way he met an old
bull in the veldt.</p>

<p>"Don't you want to go with me?" asked the
dog.</p>

<p>"Where?" was the reply.</p>

<p>"To the land of the aged," said the dog,
"where troubles don't disturb you and thanklessness
does not deface the deeds of man."</p>

<p>"Good," said the bull, "I am your companion."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>The two now walked on and found a ram.</p>

<p>The dog laid the plan before him, and all
moved off together, until they afterwards came
successively upon a donkey, a cat, a cock, and
a goose.</p>

<p>These joined their company, and the seven
set out on their journey.</p>

<p>Late one night they came to a house and
through the open door they saw a table spread
with all kinds of nice food, of which some robbers
were having their fill. It would help nothing
to ask for admittance, and seeing that they
were hungry, they must think of something else.</p>

<p>Therefore the donkey climbed up on the bull,
the ram on the donkey, the dog on the ram, the
cat on the dog, the goose on the cat, and the
cock on the goose, and with one accord they
all let out terrible (threatening) noises (cryings).</p>

<p>The bull began to bellow, the donkey to bray,
the dog to bark, the ram to bleat, the cat to
mew, the goose to giggle gaggle, and the cock to
crow, all without cessation.</p>

<p>The people in the house were frightened per<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>fectly
limp; they glanced out through the front
door, and there they stared on the strange sight.
Some of them took to the ropes over the back
lower door, some disappeared through the
window, and in a few counts the house was
empty.</p>

<p>Then the seven old animals climbed down from
one another, stepped into the house, and satisfied
themselves with the delicious food.</p>

<p>But when they had finished, there still remained
a great deal of food, too much to take
with them on their remaining journey, and so
together they contrived a plan to hold their position
until the next day after breakfast.</p>

<p>The dog said, "See here, I am accustomed to
watch at the front door of my master's house,"
and thereupon flopped himself down to sleep;
the bull said, "I go behind the door," and there
he took his position; the ram said, "I will go
up on to the loft"; the donkey, "I at the middle
door"; the cat, "I in the fireplace"; the goose,
"I in the back door"; and the cock said, "I am
going to sleep on the bed."</p>

<p>The captain of the robbers after a while sent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
one of his men back to see if these creatures had
yet left the house.</p>

<p>The man came very cautiously into the neighborhood,
listened and listened, but he heard
nothing; he peeped through the window, and
saw in the grate just two coals still glimmering,
and thereupon started to walk through the
front door.</p>

<p>There the old dog seized him by the leg. He
jumped into the house, but the bull was ready,
swept him up with his horns, and tossed him on
to the loft. Here the ram received him and
pushed him off the loft again. Reaching ground,
he made for the middle door, but the donkey set
up a terrible braying and at the same time gave
him a kick that landed him in the fireplace, where
the cat flew at him and scratched him nearly to
pieces. He then jumped out through the back
door, and here the goose got him by the trousers.
When he was some distance away the cock
crowed. He thereupon ran so that you could
hear the stones rattle in the dark.</p>

<p>Purple and crimson and out of breath, he
came back to his companions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>"Frightful, frightful!" was all that they
could get from him at first, but after a while he
told them.</p>

<p>"When I looked through the window I saw
in the fireplace two bright coals shining, and
when I wanted to go through the front door to
go and look, I stepped into an iron trap. I
jumped into the house, and there some one
seized me with a fork and pitched me up on to
the loft, there again some one was ready, and
threw me down on all fours. I wanted to fly
through the middle door, but there some one
blew on a trumpet, and smote me with a sledge
hammer so that I did not know where I landed;
but coming to very quickly, I found I was in the
fireplace, and there another flew at me and
scratched the eyes almost out of my head. I
thereupon fled out of the back door, and lastly
I was attacked on the leg by the sixth with a
pair of fire tongs, and when I was still running
away, some one shouted out of the house,
'Stop him, stop h&mdash;i&mdash;m!'"</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>
<h2>THE LION AND JACKAL</h2>


<p>Not because he was exactly the most
capable or progressive fellow in the
neighborhood, but because he always
gave that idea&mdash;that is why Jackal slowly acquired
among the neighbors the name of a
"progressive man." The truly well-bred people
around him, who did not wish to hurt his feelings,
seemed to apply this name to him, instead
of, for instance, "cunning scamp," or "all-wise
rat-trap," as so many others often dubbed him.
He obtained this name of "a progressive man"
because he spoke most of the time English,
especially if he thought some of them were present
who could not understand it, and also because
he could always hold his body so much
like a judge on public occasions.</p>

<p>He had a smooth tongue, could make quite a
favorable speech, and especially with good effect
could he expatiate on the backwardness of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
others. Underneath he really was the most unlettered
man in the vicinity, but he had perfect
control over his inborn cunningness, which allowed
him for a long time to go triumphantly
through life as a man of great ability.</p>

<p>One time, for instance, he lost his tail in an
iron trap. He had long attempted to reach the
Boer's goose pen, and had framed many good
plans, but when he came to his senses, he was
sitting in front of the goose pen with his tail
in the iron trap, the dogs all the time coming
for him. When he realized what it meant, he
mustered together all his strength and pulled
his tail, which he always thought so much of,
clean off.</p>

<p>This would immediately have made him the
butt of the whole neighborhood had he not
thought of a plan. He called together a meeting
of the jackals, and made them believe that
Lion had issued a proclamation to the effect
that all jackals in the future should be tailless,
because their beautiful tails were a thorn in the
eyes of more unfortunate animals.</p>

<p>In his smooth way he told them how he re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>gretted
that the king should have the barbaric
right to interfere with his subjects. But so it
was; and he thought the sooner he paid attention
to it the safer. Therefore he had had his tail
cut off already and he should advise all his
friends to do the same. And so it happened that
once all jackals for a long time were without
tails. Later on they grew again.</p>

<p>It was about the same time that Tiger hired
Jackal as a schoolmaster. Tiger was in those
days the richest man in the surrounding country,
and as he had had to suffer a great deal
himself because he was so untutored, he wanted
his children to have the best education that could
be obtained.</p>

<p>It was shortly after a meeting, in which it
was shown how important a thing an education
was, that Tiger approached Jackal and asked
him to come and teach his children.</p>

<p>Jackal was very ready to do this. It was not
exactly his vocation, he said, but he would do it
to pass time and just out of friendship for his
neighbor. His and Tiger's farm lands lay next
each other.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>That he did not make teaching his profession
and that he possessed no degree was of no account
in the eyes of Tiger.</p>

<p>"Do not praise my goodness so much, Cousin
Jackal," laughed he. "We know your worth
well enough. Much rather would I intrust my
offspring to you than to the many so-called
schoolmasters, for it is especially my wish, as
well as that of their mother, to have our children
obtain a progressive education, and to make such
men and women of them that with the same
ability as you have they can take their lawful
places in this world."</p>

<p>"One condition," said Jackal, "I must state.
It will be very inconvenient for me, almost impossible,
to come here to your farm and hold
school. My own farm would in that case go to
pieces, and that I cannot let happen. It would
never pay me."</p>

<p>Tiger answered that it was not exactly necessary
either. In spite of their attachment to the
little ones, they saw that it would probably be
to their benefit to place them for a while in a
stranger's house.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>Jackal then told of his own bringing up by
Wolf. He remembered well how small he was
when his father sent him away to study with
Wolf. Naturally, since then, he had passed
through many schools, Wolf was only his first
teacher. And only in his later days did he realize
how much good it had done him.</p>

<p>"A man must bend the sapling while it is still
young," said he. "There is no time that the
child is so open to impressions as when he is
plastic, about the age that most of your children
are at present, and I was just thinking you
would be doing a wise thing to send them away
for quite a while."</p>

<p>He had, fortunately, just then a room in his
house that would be suited for a schoolroom,
and his wife could easily make some arrangement
for their lodging, even if they had to enlarge
their dwelling somewhat.</p>

<p>It was then and there agreed upon. Tiger's
wife was then consulted about one thing and
another, and the following day the children were
to leave.</p>

<p>"I have just thought of one more thing," re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>marked
Jackal, "seven children, besides my little
lot, will be quite a care on our hands, so
you will have to send over each week a fat lamb,
and in order not to disturb their progress, the
children will have to relinquish the idea of a
vacation spent with you for some time. When
I think they have become used to the bit, I will
inform you, and then you can come and take
them to make you a short visit, but not until
then.</p>

<p><a name="it" id="it"></a><ins title="Transcriber's Note: paragraph break inserted">"It is also better,"</ins> continued he, "that
they do not see you for the first while, but your
wife can come and see them every Saturday and
I will see to all else."</p>

<p>On the following day there was an unearthly
howling and wailing when the children were to
leave. But Tiger and their mother showed them
that it was best and that some day they would
see that it was all for their good, and that
their parents were doing it out of kindness.
Eventually they were gone.</p>

<p>The first Saturday dawned, and early that
morning Mrs. Tiger was on her way to Jackal's
dwelling, because she could not defer the time
any longer.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>She was still a long way off when Jackal
caught sight of her. He always observed neighborly
customs, and so stepped out to meet
her.</p>

<p>After they had greeted each other, Mrs. Tiger's
first question was: "Well, Cousin Jackal,
how goes everything with the small team? Are
they still all well and happy, and do they not
trouble you, Cousin Jackal, too much?"</p>

<p>"Oh, my goodness, no, Mrs. Tiger," answered
Jackal enthusiastically, "but don't let us talk
so loud, because if they heard you, it certainly
would cause them many heartfelt tears and they
might also want to go back with you and then
all our trouble would have been for nothing."</p>

<p>"But I would like to see them, Cousin
Jackal," said Mrs. Tiger a little disturbed.</p>

<p>"Why certainly, Mrs. Tiger," was his answer,
"but I do not think it is wise for them
to see you. I will lift them up to the window
one by one, and then you can put your mind
at rest concerning their health and progress."</p>

<p>After Mr. and Mrs. Jackal and Mrs. Tiger
had sat together for some time drinking coffee<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
and talking over one thing and another, Jackal
took Tiger's wife to a door and told her to look
through it, out upon the back yard. There he
would show her the children one by one, while
they would not be able to see her. Everything
was done exactly as Jackal had said, but the
sixth little tiger he picked up twice, because the
firstborn he had the day before prepared in
pickle for their Sunday meal.</p>

<p>And so it happened every Saturday until the
last little tiger&mdash;which was the youngest&mdash;had
to be lifted up seven times in succession.</p>

<p>And when Mrs. Tiger came again the following
week all was still as death and everything
seemed to have a deserted appearance on the
estate. She walked straight to the front door,
and there she found a letter in the poll grass
near the door, which read thus:</p>

<blockquote><p>"We have gone for a picnic with the children.
From there we will ride by Jackalsdance for
New Year. This is necessary for the completion
of their progressive education."</p>

<div class="right"><span class="smcap">Jackal.</span></div>
</blockquote><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>Saturday after Saturday did Mrs. Tiger go
and look, but every time Jackal's house seemed
to look more deserted; and after a while there
was a spider's web over the door and the trail
of Snake showed that he, too, had taken up his
abode there.</p>

<h2>TINK-TINKJE</h2>


<p>The birds wanted a king. Men have
a king, so have animals, and why
shouldn't they? All had assembled.</p>

<p>"The Ostrich, because he is the largest," one
called out.</p>

<p>"No, he can't fly."</p>

<p>"Eagle, on account of his strength."</p>

<p>"Not he, he is too ugly."</p>

<p>"Vulture, because he can fly the highest."</p>

<p>"No, Vulture is too dirty, his odor is terrible."</p>

<p>"Peacock, he is so beautiful."</p>

<p>"His feet are too ugly, and also his voice."</p>

<p>"Owl, because he can see well."</p>

<p>"Not Owl, he is ashamed of the light."</p>

<p>And so they got no further. Then one
shouted aloud, "He who can fly the highest will
be king." "Yes, yes," they all screamed, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
at a given signal they all ascended straight up
into the sky.</p>

<p>Vulture flew for three whole days without
stopping, straight toward the sun. Then he
cried aloud, "I am the highest, I am king."</p>

<p>"T-sie, t-sie, t-sie," he heard above him.
There Tink-tinkje was flying. He had held fast
to one of the great wing feathers of Vulture,
and had never been felt, he was so light. "T-sie,
t-sie, t-sie, I am the highest, I am king," piped
Tink-tinkje.</p>

<p>Vulture flew for another day still ascending.
"I am highest, I am king."</p>

<p>"T-sie, t-sie, t-sie, I am the highest, I am
king," Tink-tinkje mocked. There he was
again, having crept out from under the wing of
Vulture.</p>

<p>Vulture flew on the fifth day straight up in
the air. "I am the highest, I am king," he
called.</p>

<p>"T-sie, t-sie, t-sie," piped the little fellow
above him. "I am the highest, I am king."</p>

<p>Vulture was tired and now flew direct to
earth. The other birds were mad through and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
through. Tink-tinkje must die because he had
taken advantage of Vulture's feathers and there
hidden himself. All flew after him and he had
to take refuge in a mouse hole. But how were
they to get him out? Some one must stand
guard to seize him the moment he put out his
head.</p>

<p>"Owl must keep guard; he has the largest
eyes; he can see well," they exclaimed.</p>

<p>Owl went and took up his position before
the hole. The sun was warm and soon Owl became
sleepy and presently he was fast asleep.</p>

<p>Tink-tinkje peeped, saw that Owl was asleep,
and z-zip away he went. Shortly afterwards
the other birds came to see if Tink-tinkje were
still in the hole. "T-sie, t-sie," they heard in
a tree; and there the little vagabond was sitting.</p>

<p>White-crow, perfectly disgusted, turned
around and exclaimed, "Now I won't say a single
word more." And from that day to this White-crow
has never spoken. Even though you strike
him, he makes no sound, he utters no cry.</p>

<h2>THE LION AND JACKAL</h2>


<p>Lion had now caught a large eland which
lay dead on the top of a high bank.
Lion was thirsty and wanted to go and
drink water. "Jackal, look after my eland, I
am going to get a drink. Don't you eat any."</p>

<p>"Very well, Uncle Lion."</p>

<p>Lion went to the river and Jackal quietly removed
a stone on which Lion had to step to
reach the bank on his return. After that Jackal
and his wife ate heartily of the eland. Lion returned,
but could not scale the bank. "Jackal,
help me," he shouted.</p>

<p>"Yes, Uncle Lion, I will let down a rope and
then you can climb up."</p>

<p>Jackal whispered to his wife, "Give me one
of the old, thin hide ropes." And then aloud
he added, "Wife, give me one of the strong,
buffalo ropes, so Uncle Lion won't fall."</p>

<p>His wife gave him an old rotten rope. Jackal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
and his wife first ate ravenously of the meat,
then gradually let the rope down. Lion seized
it and struggled up. When he neared the brink
Jackal gave the rope a jerk. It broke and down
Lion began to roll&mdash;rolled the whole way down,
and finally lay at the foot near the river.</p>

<p>Jackal began to beat a dry hide that lay there
as he howled, cried, and shouted: "Wife, why
did you give me such a bad rope that caused
Uncle Lion to fall?"</p>

<p>Lion heard the row and roared, "Jackal, stop
beating your wife. I will hurt you if you don't
cease. Help me to climb up."</p>

<p>"Uncle Lion, I will give you a rope." Whispering
again to his wife, "Give me one of the
old, thin hide ropes," and shouting aloud again,
"Give me a strong, buffalo rope, wife, that will
not break again with Lion."</p>

<p>Jackal gave out the rope, and when Lion had
nearly reached the top, he cut the rope through.
Snap! and Lion began to roll to the bottom.
Jackal again beat on the hide and shouted,
"Wife, why did you give me such a rotten rope?
Didn't I tell you to give me a strong one?" Lion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
roared, "Jackal, stop beating your wife at once.
Help me instantly or you will be sorry."</p>

<p>"Wife," Jackal said aloud, "give me now the
strongest rope you have," and aside to her,
"Give me the worst rope of the lot."</p>

<p>Jackal again let down a rope, but just as
Lion reached the top, Jackal gave a strong tug
and broke the rope. Poor old Lion rolled down
the side of the hill and lay there roaring from
pain. He had been fatally hurt.</p>

<p>Jackal inquired, "Uncle Lion, have you hurt
yourself? Have you much pain? Wait a while,
I am coming directly to help you." Jackal and
his wife slowly walked away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>
<h2>LION AND JACKAL</h2>


<p>The Lion and the Jackal agreed to hunt
on shares, for the purpose of laying in
a stock of meat for the winter months
for their families.</p>

<p>As the Lion was by far the more expert hunter
of the two, the Jackal suggested that he (himself)
should be employed in transporting the
game to their dens, and that Mrs. Jackal and
the little Jackals should prepare and dry the
meat, adding that they would take care that
Mrs. Lion and her family should not want.</p>

<p>This was agreed to by the Lion, and the hunt
commenced.</p>

<p>After a very successful hunt, which lasted for
some time, the Lion returned to see his family,
and also to enjoy, as he thought, a plentiful
supply of his spoil; when, to his utter surprise,
he found Mrs. Lion and all the young Lions on
the point of death from sheer hunger, and in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
mangy state. The Jackal, it appeared, had
only given them a few entrails of the game, and
in such limited quantities as barely to keep them
alive; always telling them that they (i. e., the
Lion and himself) had been most unsuccessful
in their hunting; while his own family was
reveling in abundance, and each member of it
was sleek and fat.</p>

<p>This was too much for the Lion to bear. He
immediately started off in a terrible fury, vowing
certain death to the Jackal and all his family,
wherever he should meet them. The Jackal
was more or less prepared for a storm, and had
taken the precaution to remove all his belongings
to the top of a krantz (i. e., a cliff), accessible
only by a most difficult and circuitous path,
which he alone knew.</p>

<p>When the Lion saw him on the krantz, the
Jackal immediately greeted him by calling out,
"Good morning, Uncle Lion."</p>

<p>"How dare you call me uncle, you impudent
scoundrel," roared out the Lion, in a voice
of thunder, "after the way in which you have
behaved to my family?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, Uncle! How shall I explain matters?
That beast of a wife of mine!" Whack, whack
was heard, as he beat with a stick on dry
hide, which was a mere pretence for Mrs.
Jackal's back; while that lady was preinstructed
to scream whenever he operated on
the hide, which she did with a vengeance, joined
by the little Jackals, who set up a most doleful
chorus. "That wretch!" said the Jackal.
"It is all her doing. I shall kill her straight
off," and away he again belabored the hide,
while his wife and children uttered such a dismal
howl that the Lion begged of him to
leave off flogging his wife. After cooling down
a little, he invited Uncle Lion to come up and
have something to eat. The Lion, after several
ineffectual attempts to scale the precipice,
had to give it up.</p>

<p>The Jackal, always ready for emergencies,
suggested that a reim should be lowered to haul
up his uncle. This was agreed to, and when
the Lion was drawn about halfway up by the
whole family of Jackals, the reim was cleverly
cut, and down went the Lion with a tremendous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
crash which hurt him very much. Upon this,
the Jackal again performed upon the hide with
tremendous force, for their daring to give him
such a rotten reim, and Mrs. Jackal and the
little ones responded with some fearful screams
and yells. He then called loudly out to his wife
for a strong buffalo reim which would support
any weight. This again was lowered and fastened
to the Lion, when all hands pulled away
at their uncle; and, just when he had reached
so far that he could look over the precipice into
the pots to see all the fat meat cooking, and
all the biltongs hanging out to dry, the reim
was again cut, and the poor Lion fell with such
force that he was fairly stunned for some time.
After the Lion had recovered his senses, the
Jackal, in a most sympathizing tone, suggested
that he was afraid that it was of no use to attempt
to haul him up onto the precipice, and
recommended, instead, that a nice fat piece of
eland's breast be roasted and dropped into the
Lion's mouth. The Lion, half famished with
hunger, and much bruised, readily accepted the
offer, and sat eagerly awaiting the fat morsel.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
In the mean time, the Jackal had a round stone
made red-hot, and wrapped a quantity of inside
fat, or suet, round it, to make it appear like
a ball of fat. When the Lion saw it held out,
he opened his capacious mouth to the utmost
extent, and the wily Jackal cleverly dropped the
hot ball right into it, which ran through the
poor old beast, killing him on the spot.</p>

<p>It need hardly be told that there was great rejoicing
on the precipice that night.</p>

<h2>THE HUNT OF LION AND<br />
JACKAL</h2>


<p>Lion and Jackal, it is said, were one day
lying in wait for Eland. Lion shot
(with a bow) and missed, but Jackal
hit and sang out, "Hah! hah!"</p>

<p>Lion said, "No, you did not shoot anything.
It was I who hit."</p>

<p>Jackal answered, "Yea, my father, thou hast
hit."</p>

<p>Then they went home in order to return
when the eland was dead, and cut it up. Jackal,
however, turned back, unknown to Lion, hit his
nose so that the blood ran on the spoor of the
eland, and followed their track thus, in order
to cheat Lion. When he had gone some distance,
he returned by another way to the dead
eland, and creeping into its carcass, cut out all
the fat.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Lion followed the blood-stained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
spoor of Jackal, thinking that it was eland
blood, and only when he had gone some distance
did he find out that he had been deceived. He
then returned on Jackal's spoor, and reached
the dead eland, where, finding Jackal in its carcass,
he seized him by his tail and drew him out
with a swing.</p>

<p>Lion upbraided Jackal with these words:
"Why do you cheat me?"</p>

<p>Jackal answered: "No, my father, I do not
cheat you; you may know it, I think. I prepared
this fat for you, father."</p>

<p>Lion said: "Then take the fat and carry
it to your mother" (the lioness); and he gave
him the lungs to take to his own wife and children.</p>

<p>When Jackal arrived, he did not give the fat
to Lion's wife, but to his own wife and children;
he gave, however, the lungs to Lion's wife, and
he pelted Lion's little children with the lungs,
saying:</p>

<blockquote><p>
"You children of the big-pawed one!<br />
You big-pawed ones!"<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p></blockquote>

<p>He said to Lioness, "I go to help my father"
(the lion); but he went far away with his wife
and children.</p>

<h2>STORY OF LION AND LITTLE<br />
JACKAL</h2>


<p>Little Jackal one day went out
hunting, when he met Lion. Lion proposed
that they should hunt together,
on condition that if a small antelope was killed
it was to be Little Jackal's, and if a large one
was killed it was to be Lion's. Little Jackal
agreed to this.</p>

<p>The first animal killed was a large eland.
Lion was very glad, and said to Little Jackal:
"I will continue hunting while you go to my
house and call my children to carry the meat
home."</p>

<p>Little Jackal replied: "Yes, I agree to
that."</p>

<p>Lion went away to hunt. When he had gone,
Little Jackal went to his own house and called
his own children to carry away the meat. He
said: "Lion takes me for a fool if he thinks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
I will call his children while my own are dying
with hunger."</p>

<p>So Little Jackal's children carried the meat to
their home on the top of a high rock, where the
only way to get to their house was by means of
a rope.</p>

<p>Lion caught nothing more, and after a time
he went home and asked his wife where the meat
was. She told him there was no meat. He said:
"Did not Little Jackal bring a message to my
children to carry meat?"</p>

<p>His wife replied: "No, he was not here. We
are still dying with hunger."</p>

<p>Lion then went to Little Jackal's house, but
he could not get up the rock to it. So he sat
down by the water, waiting. After a time Little
Jackal went to get some water. He was
close to the water when he saw Lion. He at
once ran away, and Lion ran after him. He ran
into a hole under a tree, but Lion caught his
tail before he got far in. He said to him: "That
is not my tail you have hold of; it is a root
of the tree. If you do not believe me, take a
stone and strike it, and see if any blood comes."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>Lion let go the tail, and went for a stone to
prove what it was. While he was gone for the
stone, Little Jackal went far into the hole.
When Lion returned he could not be found.
Lion lay down by the hole and waited. After
a long time Little Jackal wanted to come out.
He went to the entrance and looked round, but
he could not see Lion. To make sure, he said:
"Ho, I see you, my master, although you are
in hiding."</p>

<p>Lion did not move from the place where he
lay concealed. Then Little Jackal went out,
and Lion pursued him, but he got away.</p>

<p>Lion watched for him, and one day, when Little
Jackal was out hunting, he came upon him
in a place where he could not escape. Lion was
just about to spring upon him, when Little
Jackal said softly: "Be still, do you not see
that bushbuck on the other side of the rock? I
am glad you have come to help me. Just remain
here while I run round and drive him
toward you."</p>

<p>Lion did so, and Little Jackal made his escape.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>At another time there was a meeting of the
animals, and Lion was the chief at the meeting.
Little Jackal wanted to attend, but there was a
law made that no one should be present unless
he had horns. So Little Jackal took wax out
of a nest of bees, and made horns for himself
with it. He fastened the horns on his head, and
went to the meeting. Lion did not know him
on account of the horns. But he sat near the
fire and went to sleep, when the horns melted.</p>

<p>Lion looked at him and saw who it was. He
immediately tried to catch him, but Little Jackal
was quick in springing away. He ran under an
overhanging rock and sang out: "Help! help!
this rock is falling upon me!"</p>

<p>Lion went for a pole to prop up the rock
that he might get at Little Jackal. While he
was away, Little Jackal escaped.</p>

<p>After that they became companions again,
and went hunting another time. They killed an
ox. Lion said: "I will watch it while you carry
the pieces away."</p>

<p>Lion gave him the breast, and said: "Take
this to my wife."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>Little Jackal took it to his own wife. When
he returned, Lion gave him a shin, and said:
"Take this to your wife."</p>

<p>Little Jackal took the shin to Lion's house.
Lion's wife said: "I cannot take this because
it should not come here."</p>

<p>Little Jackal thereupon struck Lion's wife in
the face, and went back to the place where the
ox was killed. Lion gave him a large piece of
meat and said: "Take this to my wife."</p>

<p>Little Jackal took it to his own wife. This
continued till the ox was finished. Then they
both went home. When Lion arrived at his
house he found there was weeping in his family.</p>

<p>His wife said: "Is it you who sent Little
Jackal to beat me and my children, and is it
you who sent this shin? Did I ever eat a shin?"</p>

<p>When Lion heard this he was very angry and
at once went to Little Jackal's house. When he
reached the rock, Little Jackal looked down and
said: "Who are you, and what is your name,
and whose son are you, and where are you from,
and where are you going to, and whom do you
want, and what do you want him for?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>Lion replied: "I have merely come to see
you. I wish you to let down the rope."</p>

<p>Little Jackal let down a rope made of mouse
skins, and when Lion climbed a little way up,
the rope broke, and he fell and was hurt. He
then went home.</p>

<h2>THE LIONESS AND THE<br />
OSTRICH</h2>


<p>It is said, once a lioness roared, and the ostrich
also roared. The lioness went toward
the place where the ostrich was. They met.
The lioness said to the ostrich, "Please to
roar." The ostrich roared. Then the lioness
roared. The voices were equal. The lioness
said to the ostrich, "You are my match."</p>

<p>Then the lioness said to the ostrich, "Let us
hunt game together." They saw eland and made
toward it. The lioness caught only one; the
ostrich killed a great many by striking them
with the claw which was on his leg; but the lioness
killed only one. When they had met after
the hunting they went to the game, and the lioness
saw that the ostrich had killed a great deal.</p>

<p>Now, the lioness also had young cubs. They
went to the shade to rest themselves. The
lioness said to the ostrich, "Get up and rip<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
open; let us eat." Said the ostrich, "Go and
rip open; I shall eat the blood." The lioness
stood up and ripped open, and ate with the
cubs. And when she had eaten, the ostrich got
up and ate the blood. They went to sleep.</p>

<p>The cubs played about. While they were
playing, they went to the ostrich, who was
asleep. When he went to sleep he also opened
his mouth. The young lions saw that the ostrich
had no teeth. They went to their mother
and said, "This fellow, who says he is your
equal, has no teeth; he is insulting you." Then
the lioness went to wake the ostrich, and said,
"Get up, let us fight"; and they fought. And
the ostrich said, "Go to that side of the ant-hill,
and I will go to this side of it." The ostrich
struck the ant-hill, and sent it toward the
lioness. But the second time he struck the lioness
in a vulnerable spot, near the liver, and
killed her.</p>

<h2>CROCODILE'S TREASON</h2>


<p>Crocodile was, in the days when animals
still could talk, the acknowledged
foreman of all water creatures and if
one should judge from appearances one would
say that he still is. But in those days it was
his especial duty to have a general care of all
water animals, and when one year it was exceedingly
dry, and the water of the river where they
had lived dried up and became scarce, he was
forced to make a plan to trek over to another
river a short distance from there.</p>

<p>He first sent Otter out to spy. He stayed
away two days and brought back a report that
there was still good water in the other river,
real sea-cow holes, that not even a drought of
several years could dry up.</p>

<p>After he had ascertained this, Crocodile called
to his side Tortoise and Alligator.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>"Look here," said he, "I need you two to-night
to carry a report to Lion. So then get
ready; the veldt is dry, and you will probably
have to travel for a few days without any water.
We must make peace with Lion and his subjects,
otherwise we utterly perish this year.
And he must help us to trek over to the other
river, especially past the Boer's farm that lies in
between, and to travel unmolested by any of the
animals of the veldt, so long as the trek lasts.
A fish on land is sometimes a very helpless thing,
as you all know." The two had it mighty hard
in the burning sun, and on the dry veldt, but
eventually they reached Lion and handed him
the treaty.</p>

<p>"What is going on now?" thought Lion to
himself, when he had read it. "I must consult
Jackal first," said he. But to the commissioners
he gave back an answer that he would be
the following evening with his advisers at the
appointed place, at the big vaarland willow tree,
at the farther end of the hole of water, where
Crocodile had his headquarters.</p>

<p>When Tortoise and Alligator came back,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
Crocodile was exceedingly pleased with himself
at the turn the case had taken.</p>

<p>He allowed Otter and a few others to be present
and ordered them on that evening to have
ready plenty of fish and other eatables for their
guests under the vaarland willow.</p>

<p>That evening as it grew dark Lion appeared
with Wolf, Jackal, Baboon, and a few other important
animals, at the appointed place, and
they were received in the most open-hearted manner
by Crocodile and the other water creatures.</p>

<p>Crocodile was so glad at the meeting of the
animals that he now and then let fall a great tear
of joy that disappeared into the sand. After the
other animals had done well by the fish, Crocodile
laid bare to them the condition of affairs
and opened up his plan. He wanted only peace
among all animals; for they not only destroyed
one another, but the Boer, too, would in time
destroy them all.</p>

<p>The Boer had already stationed at the source
of the river no less than three steam pumps to
irrigate his land, and the water was becoming
scarcer every day. More than this, he took ad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>vantage
of their unfortunate position by making
them sit in the shallow water and then, one
after the other, bringing about their death. As
Lion was, on this account, inclined to make
peace, it was to his glory to take this opportunity
and give his hand to these peace-making
water creatures, and carry out their part
of the contract, namely, escort them from the
dried-up water, past the Boer's farm and to the
long sea-cow pools.</p>

<p>"And what benefit shall we receive from it?"
asked Jackal.</p>

<p>"Well," answered Crocodile, "the peace made
is of great benefit to both sides. We will not
exterminate each other. If you desire to come
and drink water, you can do so with an easy
mind, and not be the least bit nervous that I,
or any one of us will seize you by the nose; and
so also with all the other animals. And from
your side we are to be freed from Elephant, who
has the habit, whenever he gets the opportunity,
of tossing us with his trunk up into some open
and narrow fork of a tree and there allowing us
to become biltong."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>Lion and Jackal stepped aside to consult with
one another, and then Lion wanted to know what
form of security he would have that Crocodile
would keep to his part of the contract.</p>

<p>"I stake my word of honor," was the prompt
answer from Crocodile, and he let drop a few
more long tears of honesty into the sand.</p>

<p>Baboon then said it was all square and honest
as far as he could see into the case. He
thought it was nonsense to attempt to dig pitfalls
for one another; because he personally was
well aware that his race would benefit somewhat
from this contract of peace and friendship.
And more than this, they must consider
that use must be made of the fast disappearing
water, for even in the best of times it was
an unpleasant thing to be always carrying your
life about in your hands. He would, however,
like to suggest to the King that it would be
well to have everything put down in writing,
so that there would be nothing to regret in case
it was needed.</p>

<p>Jackal did not want to listen to the agreement.
He could not see that it would benefit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
the animals of the veldt. But Wolf, who had
fully satisfied himself with the fish, was in an
exceptionally peace-loving mood, and he advised
Lion again to close the agreement.</p>

<p>After Lion had listened to all his advisers,
and also the pleading tones of Crocodile's followers,
he held forth in a speech in which he
said that he was inclined to enter into the agreement,
seeing that it was clear that Crocodile and
his subjects were in a very tight place.</p>

<p>There and then a document was drawn up,
and it was resolved, before midnight, to begin
the trek. Crocodile's messengers swam in all
directions to summon together the water animals
for the trek.</p>

<p>Frogs croaked and crickets chirped in the
long water grass. It was not long before all
the animals had assembled at the vaarland willow.
In the meantime Lion had sent out a few
despatch riders to his subjects to raise a commando
for an escort, and long ere midnight these
also were at the vaarland willow in the moonlight.</p>

<p>The trek then was regulated by Lion and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
Jackal. Jackal was to take the lead to act
as spy, and when he was able to draw Lion to
one side, he said to him:</p>

<p>"See here, I do not trust this affair one bit,
and I want to tell you straight out, I am going
to make tracks! I will spy for you until you
reach the sea-cow pool, but I am not going to
be the one to await your arrival there."</p>

<p>Elephant had to act as advance guard because
he could walk so softly and could hear
and smell so well. Then came Lion with one division
of the animals, then Crocodile's trek with
a flank protection of both sides, and Wolf received
orders to bring up the rear.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, while all this was being arranged,
Crocodile was smoothly preparing his treason.
He called Yellow Snake to one side and said to
him: "It is to our advantage to have these animals,
who go among us every day, and who will
continue to do so, fall into the hands of the
Boer. Listen, now! You remain behind unnoticed,
and when you hear me shout you will
know that we have arrived safely at the sea-cow
pool. Then you must harass the Boer's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
dogs as much as you can, and the rest will look
out for themselves."</p>

<p>Thereupon the trek moved on. It was necessary
to go very slowly as many of the water
animals were not accustomed to the journey on
land; but they trekked past the Boer's farm
in safety, and toward break of day they were
all safely at the sea-cow pool. There most of
the water animals disappeared suddenly into the
deep water, and Crocodile also began to make
preparations to follow their example. With
tearful eyes he said to Lion that he was, oh,
so thankful for the help, that, from pure relief
and joy, he must first give vent to his feelings
by a few screams. Thereupon he suited his
words to actions so that even the mountains
echoed, and then thanked Lion on behalf of his
subjects, and purposely continued with a long
speech, dwelling on all the benefits both sides
would derive from the agreement of peace.</p>

<p>Lion was just about to say good day and
take his departure, when the first shot fell, and
with it Elephant and a few other animals.</p>

<p>"I told you all so!" shouted Jackal from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
the other side of the sea-cow pool. "Why did
you allow yourselves to be misled by a few Crocodile
tears?"</p>

<p>Crocodile had disappeared long ago into the
water. All one saw was just a lot of bubbles;
and on the banks there was an actual war against
the animals. It simply crackled the way the
Boers shot them.</p>

<p>But most of them, fortunately, came out of
it alive.</p>

<p>Shortly after, they say, Crocodile received his
well-earned reward, when he met a driver with
a load of dynamite. And even now when the
Elephant gets the chance he pitches them up
into the highest forks of the trees.</p>

<h2>THE STORY OF A DAM</h2>


<p>There was a great drought in the land;
and Lion called together a number of
animals so that they might devise a
plan for retaining water when the rains fell.</p>

<p>The animals which attended at Lion's summons
were Baboon, Leopard, Hyena, Jackal,
Hare, and Mountain Tortoise.</p>

<p>It was agreed that they should scratch a large
hole in some suitable place to hold water; and
the next day they all began to work, with the
exception of Jackal, who continually hovered
about in that locality, and was overheard to
mutter that he was not going to scratch his
nails off in making water holes.</p>

<p>When the dam was finished the rains fell, and
it was soon filled with water, to the great delight
of those who had worked so hard at it. The
first one, however, to come and drink there,
was Jackal, who not only drank, but filled his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
clay pot with water, and then proceeded to
swim in the rest of the water, making it as muddy
and dirty as he could.</p>

<p>This was brought to the knowledge of Lion,
who was very angry and ordered Baboon to
guard the water the next day, armed with a
huge knobkirrie. Baboon was concealed in a
bush close to the water; but Jackal soon became
aware of his presence there, and guessed its
cause. Knowing the fondness of baboons for
honey, Jackal at once hit upon a plan, and
marching to and fro, every now and then dipped
his fingers into his clay pot, and licked them
with an expression of intense relish, saying, in
a low voice to himself, "I don't want any of
their dirty water when I have a pot full of delicious
honey." This was too much for poor
Baboon, whose mouth began to water. He soon
began to beg Jackal to give him a little honey,
as he had been watching for several hours, and
was very hungry and tired.</p>

<p>After taking no notice of Baboon at first,
Jackal looked round, and said, in a patronizing
manner, that he pitied such an unfortunate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
creature, and would give him some honey on
certain conditions, viz., that Baboon should give
up his knobkirrie and allow himself to be bound
by Jackal. He foolishly agreed; and was soon
tied in such a manner that he could not move
hand or foot.</p>

<p>Jackal now proceeded to drink of the water,
to fill his pot, and to swim in the sight of Baboon,
from time to time telling him what a foolish
fellow he had been to be so easily duped, and
that he (Jackal) had no honey or anything
else to give him, excepting a good blow on the
head every now and then with his own knobkirrie.</p>

<p>The animals soon appeared and found poor
Baboon in this sorry plight, looking the picture
of misery. Lion was so exasperated that he
caused Baboon to be severely punished, and to
be denounced as a fool.</p>

<p>Tortoise hereupon stepped forward, and offered
his services for the capture of Jackal.
It was at first thought that he was merely joking;
but when he explained in what manner he
proposed to catch him, his plan was consid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>ered
so feasible that his offer was accepted. He
proposed that a thick coating of "bijenwerk"
(a kind of sticky black substance found on beehives)
should be spread all over him, and that
he should then go and stand at the entrance
of the dam, on the water level, so that Jackal
might tread upon him and stick fast. This was
accordingly done and Tortoise posted there.</p>

<p>The next day, when Jackal came, he approached
the water very cautiously, and wondered
to find no one there. He then ventured
to the entrance of the water, and remarked how
kind they had been in placing there a large black
stepping-stone for him. As soon, however, as
he trod upon the supposed stone, he stuck fast,
and saw that he had been tricked; for Tortoise
now put his head out and began to move.
Jackal's hind feet being still free he threatened
to smash Tortoise with them if he did not let
him go. Tortoise merely answered, "Do as you
like." Jackal thereupon made a violent jump,
and found, with horror, that his hind feet were
now also fast. "Tortoise," said he, "I have
still my mouth and teeth left, and will eat you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
alive if you do not let me go." "Do as you
like," Tortoise again replied. Jackal, in his
endeavors to free himself, at last made a desperate
bite at Tortoise, and found himself fixed,
both head and feet. Tortoise, feeling proud of
his successful capture, now marched quietly up
to the top of the bank with Jackal on his back,
so that he could easily be seen by the animals
as they came to the water.</p>

<p>They were indeed astonished to find how cleverly
the crafty Jackal had been caught; and
Tortoise was much praised, while the unhappy
Baboon was again reminded of his misconduct
when set to guard the water.</p>

<p>Jackal was at once condemned to death by
Lion; and Hyena was to execute the sentence.
Jackal pleaded hard for mercy, but finding this
useless, he made a last request to Lion (always,
as he said, so fair and just in his dealings) that
he should not have to suffer a lingering death.</p>

<p>Lion inquired of him in what manner he
wished to die; and he asked that his tail might
be shaved and rubbed with a little fat, and that
Hyena might then swing him round twice and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
dash his brains out upon a stone. This, being
considered sufficiently fair by Lion, was ordered
by him to be carried out in his presence.</p>

<p>When Jackal's tail had been shaved and
greased, Hyena caught hold of him with great
force, and before he had fairly lifted him from
the ground, the cunning Jackal had slipped
away from Hyena's grasp, and was running for
his life, pursued by all the animals.</p>

<p>Lion was the foremost pursuer, and after a
great chase Jackal got under an overhanging
precipice, and, standing on his hind legs with
his shoulders pressed against the rock, called
loudly to Lion to help him, as the rock was falling,
and would crush them both. Lion put his
shoulders to the rock, and exerted himself to
the utmost. After some little time Jackal proposed
that he should creep slowly out, and fetch
a large pole to prop up the rock, so that Lion
could get out and save his life. Jackal did
creep out, and left Lion there to starve and die.</p>

<h2>THE DANCE FOR WATER OR<br />
RABBIT'S TRIUMPH</h2>


<p>There was a frightful drought. The
rivers after a while dried up and even
the springs gave no water.</p>

<p>The animals wandered around seeking drink,
but to no avail. Nowhere was water to be found.</p>

<p>A great gathering of animals was held: Lion,
Tiger, Wolf, Jackal, Elephant, all of them came
together. What was to be done? That was the
question. One had this plan, and another had
that; but no plan seemed of value.</p>

<p>Finally one of them suggested: "Come, let all
of us go to the dry river bed and dance; in that
way we can tread out the water."</p>

<p>Good! Everyone was satisfied and ready to
begin instantly, excepting Rabbit, who said, "I
will not go and dance. All of you are mad to
attempt to get water from the ground by dancing."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>The other animals danced and danced, and ultimately
danced the water to the surface. How
glad they were. Everyone drank as much as
he could, but Rabbit did not dance with them.
So it was decided that Rabbit should have no
water.</p>

<p>He laughed at them: "I will nevertheless
drink some of your water."</p>

<p>That evening he proceeded leisurely to the
river bed where the dance had been, and drank
as much as he wanted. The following morning
the animals saw the footprints of Rabbit in the
ground, and Rabbit shouted to them: "Aha! I
did have some of the water, and it was most
refreshing and tasted fine."</p>

<p>Quickly all the animals were called together.
What were they to do? How were they to get
Rabbit in their hands? All had some means to
propose; the one suggested this, and the other
that.</p>

<p>Finally old Tortoise moved slowly forward,
foot by foot: "I will catch Rabbit."</p>

<p>"You? How? What do you think of yourself?"
shouted the others in unison.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>"Rub my shell with pitch,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and I will go to
the edge of the water and lie down. I will then
resemble a stone, so that when Rabbit steps on
me his feet will stick fast."</p>

<p>"Yes! Yes! That's good."</p>

<p>And in a one, two, three, Tortoise's shell was
covered with pitch, and foot by foot he moved
away to the river. At the edge, close to the
water, he lay down and drew his head into his
shell.</p>

<p>Rabbit during the evening came to get a
drink. "Ha!" he chuckled sarcastically, "they
are, after all, quite decent. Here they have
placed a stone, so now I need not unnecessarily
wet my feet."</p>

<p>Rabbit trod with his left foot on the stone,
and there it stuck. Tortoise then put his head
out. "Ha! old Tortoise! And it's you, is it,
that's holding me. But here I still have another
foot. I'll give you a good clout." Rabbit gave
Tortoise what he said he would with his right
fore foot, hard and straight; and there his foot
remained.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>
<p>"I have yet a hind foot, and with it I'll kick
you." Rabbit drove his hind foot down. This
also rested on Tortoise where it struck.</p>

<p>"But still another foot remains, and now I'll
tread you." He stamped his foot down, but it
stuck like the others.</p>

<p>He used his head to hammer Tortoise, and his
tail as a whip, but both met the same fate as
his feet, so there he was tight and fast down to
the pitch.</p>

<p>Tortoise now slowly turned himself round and
foot by foot started for the other animals, with
Rabbit on his back.</p>

<p>"Ha! ha! ha! Rabbit! How does it look
now? Insolence does not pay after all," shouted
the animals.</p>

<p>Now advice was sought. What should they
do with Rabbit? He certainly must die. But
how? One said, "Behead him"; another,
"Some severe penalty."</p>

<p>"Rabbit, how are we to kill you?"</p>

<p>"It does not affect me," Rabbit said. "Only
a shameful death please do not pronounce."</p>

<p>"And what is that?" they all shouted.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>"To take me by my tail and dash my head
against a stone; that I pray and beseech you
don't do."</p>

<p>"No, but just so you'll die. That is decided."</p>

<p>It was decided Rabbit should die by taking
him by his tail and dashing his head to pieces
against some stone. But who is to do it?</p>

<p>Lion, because he is the most powerful one.</p>

<p>Good! Lion should do it. He stood up,
walked to the front, and poor Rabbit was
brought to him. Rabbit pleaded and beseeched
that he couldn't die such a miserable death.</p>

<p>Lion took Rabbit firmly by the tail and
swung him around. The white skin slipped off
from Rabbit, and there Lion stood with the
white bit of skin and hair in his paw. Rabbit
was free.</p>

<h2>JACKAL AND MONKEY</h2>


<p>Every evening Jackal went to the
Boer's kraal. He crept through the
sliding door and stole a fat young
lamb. This, clever Jackal did several times in
succession. Boer set a wip<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> for him at the
door. Jackal went again and zip&mdash;there he
was caught around the body by the noose. He
swung and swayed high in the air and couldn't
touch ground. The day began to dawn and
Jackal became uneasy.</p>

<p>On a stone kopje, Monkey sat. When it became
light he could see the whole affair, and
descended hastily for the purpose of mocking
Jackal. He went and sat on the wall. "Ha,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>ha, good morning. So there you are hanging
now, eventually caught."</p>

<p>"What? I caught? I am simply swinging
for my pleasure; it is enjoyable."</p>

<p>"You fibber. You are caught in the wip."</p>

<p>"If you but realized how nice it was to swing
and sway like this, you wouldn't hesitate.
Come, try it a little. You feel so healthy and
strong for the day, and you never tire afterwards."</p>

<p>"No, I won't. You are caught."</p>

<p>After a while Jackal convinced Monkey. He
sprang from the kraal wall, and freeing Jackal,
adjusted the noose around his own body.
Jackal quickly let go and began to laugh, as
Monkey was now swinging high in the air.</p>

<p>"Ha, ha, ha," he laughed. "Now Monkey
is in the wip."</p>

<p>"Jackal, free me," he screamed.</p>

<p>"There, Boer is coming," shouted Jackal.</p>

<p>"Jackal, free me of this, or I'll break your
playthings."</p>

<p>"No, there Boer is coming with his gun; you
rest a while in the noose."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>"Jackal, quickly make me free."</p>

<p>"No, here's Boer already, and he's got his
gun. Good morning." And with these parting
words he ran away as fast as he could. Boer
came and saw Monkey in the wip.</p>

<p>"So, so, Monkey, now you are caught. You
are the fellow who has been stealing my lambs,
hey?"</p>

<p>"No, Boer, no," screamed Monkey, "not I,
but Jackal."</p>

<p>"No, I know you; you aren't too good for
that."</p>

<p>"No, Boer, no, not I, but Jackal," Monkey
stammered.</p>

<p>"Oh, I know you. Just wait a little," and
Boer, raising his gun, aimed and shot poor
Monkey dead.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>
<h2>LION'S SHARE</h2>


<p>Lion and Jackal went together a-hunting.
They shot with arrows. Lion
shot first, but his arrow fell short of
its aim; but Jackal hit the game, and joyfully
cried out, "It has hit."</p>

<p>Lion looked at him with his two large eyes;
Jackal, however, did not lose his countenance,
but said, "No, uncle, I mean to say that you
have hit." Then they followed the game, and
Jackal passed the arrow of Lion without drawing
the latter's attention to it. When they
arrived at a crossway, Jackal said: "Dear uncle,
you are old and tired; stay here." Jackal
went then on a wrong track, beat his nose, and,
in returning, let the blood drop from it like
traces of game. "I could not find anything,"
he said, "but I met with traces of blood. You
had better go yourself to look for it. In the
meantime I shall go this other way."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>Jackal soon found the killed animal, crept
inside of it, and devoured the best portion; but
his tail remained outside, and when Lion arrived,
he got hold of it, pulled Jackal out,
and threw him on the ground with these words:
"You rascal!"</p>

<p>Jackal rose quickly again, complained of the
rough handling, and asked, "What have I now
done, dear uncle? I was busy cutting out the
best part."</p>

<p>"Now let us go and fetch our wives," said
Lion, but Jackal entreated his dear uncle to
remain at the place because he was old. Jackal
then went away, taking with him two portions
of the flesh, one for his own wife, but the best
part for the wife of Lion. When Jackal arrived
with the flesh, the children of Lion, seeing
him, began to jump, and clapping their
hands, cried out: "There comes cousin with
flesh!" Jackal threw, grumbling, the worst
portion to them, and said, "There, you brood
of the big-eyed one!" Then he went to his own
house and told his wife immediately to break up
the house, and to go where the killed game was.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
Lioness wished to do the same, but he forbade
her, and said that Lion would himself come to
fetch her.</p>

<p>When Jackal, with his wife and children,
arrived in the neighborhood of the killed animal,
he ran into a thorn bush, scratched his face
so that it bled, and thus made his appearance
before Lion, to whom he said, "Ah! what a
wife you have got. Look here, how she scratched
my face when I told her that she should come
with us. You must fetch her yourself; I cannot
bring her." Lion went home very angry. Then
Jackal said, "Quick, let us build a tower."
They heaped stone upon stone, stone upon
stone, stone upon stone; and when it was high
enough, everything was carried to the top of
it. When Jackal saw Lion approaching with
his wife and children, he cried out to him:</p>

<p>"Uncle, whilst you were away we have built
a tower, in order to be better able to see
game."</p>

<p>"All right," said Lion; "but let me come
up to you."</p>

<p>"Certainly, dear uncle; but how will you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
manage to come up? We must let down a
thong for you."</p>

<p>Lion tied the thong around his body and
Jackal began drawing him up, but when nearly
to the top Jackal cried to Lion, "My, uncle,
how heavy you are!" Then, unseen by Lion,
he cut the thong. Lion fell to the ground,
while Jackal began loudly and angrily to scold
his wife, and then said, "Go, wife, fetch me a
new thong"&mdash;"an old one," he said aside to
her.</p>

<p>Lion again tied himself to the thong, and,
just as he was near the top, Jackal cut the
thong as before; Lion fell heavily to the bottom,
groaning aloud, as he had been seriously
hurt.</p>

<p>"No," said Jackal, "that will never do: you
must, however, manage to come up high enough
so that you may get a mouthful at least." Then
aloud he ordered his wife to prepare a good
piece, but aside he told her to make a stone hot,
and to cover it with fat. Then he drew Lion
up once more, and complaining how heavy he
was to hold, told him to open his mouth, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
thereupon threw the hot stone down his throat.
Lion fell to the ground and lay there pleading
for water, while Jackal climbed down and made
his escape.</p>

<h2>JACKAL'S BRIDE</h2>


<p>Jackal, it is said, married Hyena, and
carried off a cow belonging to the ants,
to slaughter her for the wedding; and
when he had slaughtered her, he put the cowskin
over his bride; and when he had fixed a
pole (on which to hang the flesh), he placed
on the top of the pole (which was forked) the
hearth for the cooking, in order to cook upon it
all sorts of delicious food. There came also
Lion, and wished to go up. Jackal, therefore,
asked his little daughter for a thong with which
he could pull Lion up; and he began to pull
him up; and when his face came near to the
cooking-pot, he cut the thong in two, so that
Lion tumbled down. Then Jackal upbraided
his little daughter with these words: "Why do
you give me such an old thong?" And he
added, "Give me a fresh thong." She gave him
a new thong, and he pulled Lion up again, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
when his face came near the pot, which stood
on the fire, he said, "open your mouth." Then
he put into his mouth a hot piece of quartz
which had been boiled together with the fat, and
the stone went down, burning his throat. Thus
died Lion.</p>

<p>There came also the ants running after the
cow, and when Jackal saw them he fled. Then
they beat the bride in her brookaross dress.
Hyena, believing that it was Jackal, said:</p>

<p>"You tawny rogue! have you not played at
beating long enough? Have you no more loving
game than this?"</p>

<p>But when she had bitten a hole through the
cowskin, she saw that they were other people;
then she fled, falling here and there, yet made
her escape.</p>

<h2>THE STORY OF HARE</h2>


<p>Once upon a time the animals made a
kraal and put some fat in it. They
agreed that one of their number
should remain to be the keeper of the gate. The
first one that was appointed was the coney (imbila).
He agreed to take charge, and all the
others went away. In a short time the coney
fell asleep, when the inkalimeva (a fabulous animal)
went in and ate all the fat. After doing
this, he threw a little stone at the coney.</p>

<p>The coney started up and cried out: "The
fat belonging to all the animals has been eaten
by the inkalimeva."</p>

<p>It repeated this cry several times, calling out
very loudly. The animals at a distance heard
it, they ran to the kraal, and when they saw
that the fat was gone they killed the coney.</p>

<p>They put fat in the kraal a second time,
and appointed the muishond (ingaga) to keep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
the gate. The muishond consented, and the
animals went away as before. After a little
time the inkalimeva came to the kraal, bringing
some honey with it. It invited the keeper
of the gate to eat honey, and while the muishond
was enjoying himself the inkalimeva went
in and stole all the fat. It threw a stone at
the muishond, which caused him to look up.</p>

<p>The muishond cried out: "The fat belonging
to all the animals has been eaten by the inkalimeva."</p>

<p>As soon as the animals heard the cry, they
ran to the kraal and killed the muishond.</p>

<p>They put fat in the kraal a third time, and
appointed the duiker (impunzi) to be the keeper
of the gate. The duiker agreed, and the others
went away. In a short time the inkalimeva made
its appearance. It proposed to the duiker that
they should play hide and look for. The duiker
agreed to this. Then the inkalimeva hid itself,
and the duiker looked for it till he was so
tired that he lay down and went to sleep. When
the duiker was asleep, the inkalimeva ate up
all the fat.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>Then it threw a stone at the duiker, which
caused him to jump up and cry out: "The
fat belonging to all the animals has been eaten
by the inkalimeva."</p>

<p>The animals, when they heard the cry, ran
to the kraal and killed the duiker.</p>

<p>They put fat in the kraal the fourth time,
and appointed the bluebuck (inputi) to be the
keeper of the gate. When the animals went
away, the inkalimeva came as before.</p>

<p>It said: "What are you doing by yourself?"</p>

<p>The bluebuck answered: "I am watching the
fat belonging to all the animals."</p>

<p>The inkalimeva said: "I will be your companion.
Come, let us scratch each other's
heads."</p>

<p>The bluebuck agreed to this. The inkalimeva
sat down and scratched the head of the other
till he went to sleep. Then it arose and ate all
the fat. When it had finished, it threw a stone
at the bluebuck and awakened him.</p>

<p>The bluebuck saw what had happened and
cried out: "The fat belonging to all the animals
has been eaten by the inkalimeva."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>Then the animals ran up and killed the bluebuck
also.</p>

<p>They put fat in the kraal the fifth time, and
appointed the porcupine (incanda) to be the
keeper of the gate. The animals went away,
and the inkalimeva came as before.</p>

<p>It said to the porcupine, "Let us run a race
against each other."</p>

<p>It let the porcupine beat in this race.</p>

<p>Then it said, "I did not think you could
run so fast, but let us try again." They ran
again, and it allowed the porcupine to beat the
second time. They ran till the porcupine was
so tired that he said, "Let us rest now."</p>

<p>They sat down to rest, and the porcupine went
to sleep. Then the inkalimeva rose up and ate
all the fat. When it had finished eating, it
threw a stone at the porcupine, which caused him
to jump up.</p>

<p>He called out with a loud voice, "The fat belonging
to all the animals has been eaten by the
inkalimeva."</p>

<p>Then the animals came running up and put
the porcupine to death.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>They put fat in the kraal the sixth time,
and selected the hare (umvundla) to be the
keeper of the gate. At first the hare would not
consent.</p>

<p>He said, "The coney is dead, and the muishond
is dead, and the duiker is dead, and the
bluebuck is dead, and the porcupine is dead,
and you will kill me also."</p>

<p>They promised him that they would not kill
him, and after a good deal of persuasion he at
last agreed to keep the gate. When the animals
were gone he laid himself down, but he only
pretended to be asleep.</p>

<p>In a short time the inkalimeva went in, and
was just going to take the fat when the hare
cried out: "Let the fat alone."</p>

<p>The inkalimeva said, "Please let me have
this little bit only."</p>

<p>The hare answered, mocking, "Please let me
have this little bit only."</p>

<p>After that they became companions. The
hare proposed that they should fasten each
other's tail, and the inkalimeva agreed. The
inkalimeva fastened the tail of the hare first.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>The hare said, "Don't tie my tail so tight."</p>

<p>Then the hare fastened the tail of the inkalimeva.</p>

<p>The inkalimeva said, "Don't tie my tail so
tight," but the hare made no answer. After
tying the tail of the inkalimeva very fast, the
hare took his club and killed it. The hare took
the tail of the inkalimeva and ate it, all except
a little piece which he hid in the fence.</p>

<p>Then he called out, "The fat belonging to
all the animals has been eaten by the inkalimeva."</p>

<p>The animals came running back, and when
they saw that the inkalimeva was dead they
rejoiced greatly. They asked the hare for the
tail, which should be kept for the chief.</p>

<p>The hare replied, "The one I killed had no
tail."</p>

<p>They said, "How can an inkalimeva be without
a tail?"</p>

<p>They began to search, and at length they
found a piece of the tail in the fence. They
told the chief that the hare had eaten the tail.</p>

<p>He said, "Bring him to me!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>All the animals ran after the hare, but he fled,
and they could not catch him. The hare ran
into a hole, at the mouth of which the animals
set a snare, and then went away. The hare remained
in the hole for many days, but at length
he managed to get out without being caught.</p>

<p>He went to a place where he found a bushbuck
(imbabala) building a hut. There was a
pot with meat in it on the fire.</p>

<p>He said to the bushbuck, "Can I take this
little piece of meat?"</p>

<p>The bushbuck answered, "You must not
do it."</p>

<p>But he took the meat and ate it all. Afterwards
he whistled in a particular manner, and
there fell a storm of hail which killed the bushbuck.
Then he took the skin of the bushbuck,
and made for himself a mantle.</p>

<p>After this the hare went into the forest to
procure some weapons to fight with. While he
was cutting a stick the monkeys threw leaves
upon him. He called to them to come down
and beat him. They came down, but he killed
them all with his weapons.</p>

<h2>THE WHITE MAN AND SNAKE</h2>


<p>A white man, it is said, met Snake
upon whom a large stone had fallen
and covered her so that she could not
rise. The White Man lifted the stone off
Snake, but when he had done so, she wanted to
bite him. The White Man said, "Stop! let us
both go first to some wise people." They went
to Hyena, and the White Man asked him, "Is
it right that Snake should want to bite me,
when I helped her as she lay under a stone and
could not rise?"</p>

<p>Hyena (who thought he would get his share
of the White Man's body) said, "If you were
bitten what would it matter?"</p>

<p>Then Snake wanted to bite him, but the
White Man said again, "Wait a little, and let
us go to other wise people, that I may hear
whether this is right."</p>

<p>They went and met Jackal. The White Man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
said to Jackal, "Is it right for Snake to want
to bite me, when I lifted up the stone which lay
upon her?"</p>

<p>Jackal replied, "I do not believe that Snake
could be covered by a stone so she could not
rise. Unless I saw it with my two eyes, I would
not believe it. Therefore, come let us go and
see the place where you say it happened whether
it can be true."</p>

<p>They went, and arrived at the place where
it had happened. Jackal said, "Snake, lie
down, and let thyself be covered."</p>

<p>Snake did so, and the White Man covered
her with the stone; but although she exerted
herself very much, she could not rise. Then
the White Man wanted again to release Snake,
but Jackal interfered, and said, "Do not lift
the stone. She wanted to bite you, therefore
she may rise by herself."</p>

<p>Then they both went away and left Snake
under the stone.</p>

<h2>ANOTHER VERSION OF THE<br />
SAME FABLE</h2>


<p>A Dutchman was walking by himself
and saw Snake lying under a large
stone. Snake implored his help; but
when she had become free she said, "Now I
shall eat you."</p>

<p>The Man answered, "That is not right. Let
us first go to Hare."</p>

<p>When Hare had heard the affair, he said,
"It is right."</p>

<p>"No," said the Man, "let us ask Hyena."</p>

<p>Hyena declared the same, saying, "It is
right."</p>

<p>"Now let us ask Jackal," said the Man in
his despair.</p>

<p>Jackal answered very slowly and considerately,
doubting the whole affair, and demanding
to see first the place, and whether the Man was
able to lift the stone. Snake lay down, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
the Man, to prove the truth of his account, put
the stone again over her.</p>

<p>When she was fast, Jackal said, "Now let
her lie there."</p>

<h2>CLOUD-EATING</h2>


<p>Jackal and Hyena were together, it is
said, when a white cloud rose. Jackal
descended upon it, and ate of the cloud
as if it were fat.</p>

<p>When he wanted to come down, he said to
Hyena, "My sister, as I am going to divide
with thee, catch me well." So she caught him,
and broke his fall. Then she also went up and
ate there, high up on the top of the cloud.</p>

<p>When she was satisfied, she said, "My greyish
brother, now catch me well." The greyish
rogue said to his friend, "My sister, I shall
catch thee well. Come therefore down."</p>

<p>He held up his hands, and she came down
from the cloud, and when she was near, Jackal
cried out (painfully jumping to one side), "My
sister, do not take it ill. Oh me! Oh me! A
thorn has pricked me and sticks in me." Thus
she fell down from above, and was sadly hurt.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>Since that day, it is said that Hyena's hind
feet have been shorter and smaller than the
front ones.</p>

<h2>LION'S ILLNESS</h2>


<p>Lion, it is said, was ill, and they all
went to see him in his suffering. But
Jackal did not go, because the traces
of the people who went to see him did not turn
back. Thereupon, he was accused by Hyena,
who said, "Though I go to look, yet Jackal
does not want to come and look at the man's
sufferings."</p>

<p>Then Lion let Hyena go, in order that she
might catch Jackal; and she did so, and brought
him.</p>

<p>Lion asked Jackal: "Why did you not come
here to see me?"</p>

<p>Jackal said, "Oh, no! when I heard that
my uncle was so very ill, I went to the witch
(doctor) to consult him, whether and what medicine
would be good for my uncle against the
pain. The doctor said to me, 'Go and tell
your uncle to take hold of Hyena and draw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
off her skin, and put it on while it is still warm.
Then he will recover.' Hyena is one who does
not care for my uncle's sufferings."</p>

<p>Lion followed his advice, got hold of Hyena,
drew the skin over her ears, whilst she howled
with all her might, and put it on.</p>

<h2>JACKAL, DOVE, AND HERON</h2>


<p>Jackal, it is said, came once to Dove,
who lived on the top of a rock, and said,
"Give me one of your little ones."</p>

<p>Dove answered, "I shall not do anything of
the kind."</p>

<p>Jackal said, "Give me it at once! Otherwise,
I shall fly up to you." Then she threw
one down to him.</p>

<p>He came back another day and demanded
another little one, and she gave it to him.
After Jackal had gone, Heron came, and asked,
"Dove, why do you cry?"</p>

<p>Dove answered him, "Jackal has taken away
my little ones; it is for this that I cry." He
asked her, "In what manner did he take them?"
She answered him, "When he asked me I refused
him; but when he said, 'I shall at once
fly up, therefore give me it,' I threw it down
to him."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>Heron said, "Are you such a fool as to give
your young ones to Jackal, who cannot fly?"
Then, with the admonition to give no more, he
went away.</p>

<p>Jackal came again, and said, "Dove, give me
a little one." Dove refused, and told him that
Heron had told her that he could not fly up.
Jackal said, "I shall catch him."</p>

<p>So when Heron came to the banks of the
water, Jackal asked him: "Brother Heron,
when the wind comes from this side, how will you
stand?" He turned his neck towards him and
said, "I stand thus, bending my neck on one
side." Jackal asked him again, "When a storm
comes and when it rains, how do you stand?"
He said to him: "I stand thus, indeed, bending
my neck down."</p>

<p>Then Jackal beat him on his neck, and broke
his neck in the middle.</p>

<p>Since that day Heron's neck is bent.</p>

<h2>COCK AND JACKAL</h2>


<p>Cock, it is said, was once overtaken
by Jackal, and caught. Cock said to Jackal,
"Please, pray first (before you
kill me), as the white man does."</p>

<p>Jackal asked, "In what manner does
he pray? Tell me."</p>

<p>"He folds his hands in praying,"
said Cock. Jackal folded his hands and
prayed. Then Cock spoke again; "You
ought not to look about you as you do.
You had better shut your eyes." He did
so; and Cock flew away, upbraiding at the
same time Jackal with these words, "You
rogue! do you also pray?"</p>

<p>There sat Jackal, speechless, because
he had been outdone.</p>

<h2>ELEPHANT AND TORTOISE</h2>


<p>Two powers, Elephant and Rain, had a
dispute. Elephant said, "If you say
that you nourish me, in what way is it
that you say so?" Rain answered, "If
you say that I do not nourish you, when
I go away, will you not die?" And Rain
then departed.</p>

<p>Elephant said, "Vulture! cast lots
to make rain for me."</p>

<p>Vulture said, "I will not cast lots."</p>

<p>Then Elephant said to Crow, "Cast
lots!" who answered, "Give the things
with which I may cast lots." Crow cast
lots and rain fell. It rained at the
lagoons, but they dried up, and only one
lagoon remained.</p>

<p>Elephant went a-hunting. There was,
however, Tortoise, to whom Elephant said,
"Tortoise, remain at the water!" Thus
Tortoise was left behind when Elephant
went a-hunting.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>There came Giraffe, and said to Tortoise,
"Give me water!" Tortoise answered, "The
water belongs to Elephant."</p>

<p>There came Zebra, who said to Tortoise,
"Give me water!" Tortoise answered, "The
water belongs to Elephant."</p>

<p>There came Gemsbok, and said to Tortoise,
"Give me water!" Tortoise answered, "The
water belongs to Elephant."</p>

<p>There came Wildebeest, and said, "Give me
water!" Tortoise said, "The water belongs to
Elephant."</p>

<p>There came Roodebok, and said to Tortoise,
"Give me water!" Tortoise answered, "The
water belongs to Elephant."</p>

<p>There came Springbok, and said to Tortoise,
"Give me water!" Tortoise said, "The water
belongs to Elephant."</p>

<p>There came Jackal, and said to Tortoise,
"Give me water!" Tortoise said, "The water
belongs to Elephant."</p>

<p>There came Lion, and said, "Little Tortoise,
give me water!" When little Tortoise was
about to say something, Lion got hold of him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
and beat him; Lion drank of the water, and
since then the animals drink water.</p>

<p>When Elephant came back from the hunting,
he said, "Little Tortoise, is there water?"
Tortoise answered, "The animals have drunk
the water." Elephant asked, "Little Tortoise,
shall I chew you or swallow you down?" Little
Tortoise said, "Swallow me, if you please!"
and Elephant swallowed him whole.</p>

<p>After Elephant had swallowed Little Tortoise,
and he had entered his body, he tore off
his liver, heart, and kidneys. Elephant said,
"Little Tortoise, you kill me."</p>

<p>So Elephant died; but little Tortoise came
out of his dead body, and went wherever he
liked.</p>

<h2>ANOTHER VERSION OF THE<br />
SAME FABLE</h2>


<p>Giraffe and Tortoise, they say, met
one day. Giraffe said to Tortoise,
"At once I could trample you to
death." Tortoise, being afraid, remained silent.
Then Giraffe said, "At once I could swallow
you." Tortoise said, in answer to this, "Well,
I just belong to the family of those whom it
has always been customary to swallow." Then
Giraffe swallowed Tortoise; but when the latter
was being gulped down, he stuck in Giraffe's
throat, and as the latter could not get it down,
he was choked to death.</p>

<p>When Giraffe was dead, Tortoise crawled out
and went to Crab (who is considered as the
mother of Tortoise), and told her what had
happened. Then Crab said:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<blockquote><p>
"The little Crab! I could sprinkle it under its arm with Boochoo,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a><br />

<p>Tortoise answered its mother and said:</p>

<p>Then they went and fed for a whole year on
the remains of Giraffe.</p>

<h2>TORTOISES HUNTING<br />
OSTRICHES</h2>


<p>One day, it is said, the Tortoises held
a council how they might hunt Ostriches,
and they said, "Let us, on
both sides, stand in rows near each other, and
let one go to hunt the Ostriches, so that they
must flee along through the midst of us." They
did so, and as they were many, the Ostriches
were obliged to run along through the midst
of them. During this they did not move, but,
remaining always in the same places, called each
to the other, "Are you there?" and each one
answered, "I am here." The Ostriches hearing
this, ran so tremendously that they quite exhausted
their strength, and fell down. Then
the Tortoises assembled by-and-by at the place
where the Ostriches had fallen, and devoured
them.</p>

<h2>THE JUDGMENT OF BABOON</h2>


<p>One day, it is said, the following story
happened:</p>

<p>Mouse had torn the clothes of
Itkler (the tailor), who then went to Baboon,
and accused Mouse with these words:</p>

<p>"In this manner I come to thee: Mouse has
torn my clothes, but will not know anything
of it, and accuses Cat; Cat protests likewise her
innocence, and says, 'Dog must have done it';
but Dog denies it also, and declares Wood has
done it; and Wood throws the blame on Fire,
and says, 'Fire did it'; Fire says, 'I have not,
Water did it'; Water says, 'Elephant tore the
clothes'; and Elephant says, 'Ant tore them.'
Thus a dispute has arisen among them. Therefore,
I, Itkler, come to thee with this proposition:
Assemble the people and try them in order
that I may get satisfaction."</p>

<p>Thus he spake, and Baboon assembled them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
for trial. Then they made the same excuses
which had been mentioned by Itkler, each one
putting the blame upon the other.</p>

<p>So Baboon did not see any other way of
punishing them, save through making them punish
each other; he therefore said,</p>

<p>"Mouse, give Itkler satisfaction."</p>

<p>Mouse, however, pleaded not guilty. But
Baboon said, "Cat, bite Mouse." She did so.</p>

<p>He then put the same question to Cat, and
when she exculpated herself, Baboon called to
Dog, "Here, bite Cat."</p>

<p>In this manner Baboon questioned them all,
one after the other, but they each denied the
charge. Then he addressed the following words
to them, and said,</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">"Wood, beat Dog.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">Fire, burn Wood.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">Water, quench Fire.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">Elephant, drink Water.</span><br />
Ant, bite Elephant in his most tender parts."<br />
</p>

<p>They did so, and since that day they cannot
any longer agree with each other.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>Ant enters into Elephant's most tender parts
and bites him.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">Elephant swallows Water.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">Water quenches Fire.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">Fire consumes Wood.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">Wood beats Dog.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">Dog bites Cat.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">And Cat bites Mouse.</span><br />
</p>

<p>Through this judgment Itkler got satisfaction
and addressed Baboon in the following
manner:</p>

<p>"Yes! Now I am content, since I have received
satisfaction, and with all my heart I thank
thee, Baboon, because thou hast exercised justice
on my behalf and given me redress."</p>

<p>Then Baboon said, "From to-day I will not
any longer be called Jan, but Baboon shall be
my name."</p>

<p>Since that time Baboon walks on all fours,
having probably lost the privilege of walking
erect through this foolish judgment.</p>

<h2>LION AND BABOON</h2>


<p>Baboon, it is said, once worked bamboos,
sitting on the edge of a precipice,
and Lion stole upon him. Baboon,
however, had fixed some round, glistening, eye-like
plates on the back of his head. When,
therefore, Lion crept upon him, he thought,
when Baboon was looking at him, that he sat
with his back towards him, and crept with all
his might upon him. When, however, Baboon
turned his back towards him, Lion thought that
he was seen, and hid himself. Thus, when Baboon
looked at him, he crept upon him.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> When
he was near him Baboon looked up, and Lion
continued to creep upon him. Baboon said
(aside), "Whilst I am looking at him he steals
upon me, whilst my hollow eyes are on him."</p>

<p>When at last Lion sprung at him, he lay
(quickly) down upon his face, and Lion jumped
over him, falling down the precipice, and was
dashed to pieces.</p>

<h2>THE ZEBRA STALLION</h2>


<p>The Baboons, it is said, used to disturb
the Zebra Mares in drinking. But
one of the Mares became the mother
of a foal. The others then helped her to suckle
(the young stallion), that he might soon grow
up.</p>

<p>When he was grown up and they were in want
of water, he brought them to the water. The
Baboons, seeing this, came, as they formerly
were used to do, into their way, and kept them
from the water.</p>

<p>While the Mares stood thus, the Stallion
stepped forward, and spoke to one of the Baboons,
"Thou gum-eater's child!"</p>

<p>The Baboon said to the Stallion, "Please
open thy mouth, that I may see what thou livest
on." The Stallion opened his mouth, and it
was milky.</p>

<p>Then the Stallion said to the Baboon, "Please<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
open thy mouth also, that I may see." The Baboon
did so, and there was some gum in it. But
the Baboon quickly licked some milk off the
Stallion's tongue. The Stallion on this became
angry, took the Baboon by his shoulders, and
pressed him upon a hot, flat rock. Since that
day the Baboon has a bald place on his back.</p>

<p>The Baboon said, lamenting, "I, my mother's
child, I, the gum-eater, am outdone by this milk-eater!"</p>

<h2>WHEN LION COULD FLY</h2>


<p>Lion, it is said, used once to fly, and
at that time nothing could live before
him. As he was unwilling that the
bones of what he caught should be broken into
pieces, he made a pair of White Crows watch
the bones, leaving them behind at the kraal
whilst he went a-hunting. But one day Great
Frog came there, broke the bones in pieces,
and said, "Why can men and animals live no
longer?" And he added these words, "When
he comes, tell him that I live at yonder pool; if
he wishes to see me, he must come there."</p>

<p>Lion, lying in wait (for game), wanted to
fly up, but found he could not fly. Then he
got angry, thinking that at the kraal something
was wrong, and returned home. When he arrived
he asked, "What have you done that I
cannot fly?" Then they answered and said,
"Some one came here, broke the bones into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
pieces, and said, 'If he want me, he may look
for me at yonder pool!'" Lion went, and
arrived while Frog was sitting at the water's
edge, and he tried to creep stealthily upon him.
When he was about to get hold of him, Frog
said, "Ho!" and, diving, went to the other
side of the pool, and sat there. Lion pursued
him; but as he could not catch him he returned
home.</p>

<p>From that day, it is said, Lion walked on
his feet, and also began to creep upon (his
game); and the White Crows became entirely
dumb since the day that they said, "Nothing
can be said of that matter."</p>

<h2>LION WHO THOUGHT HIMSELF<br />
WISER THAN HIS<br />
MOTHER</h2>


<p>It is said that when Lion and Gurikhoisip
(the Only man), together with Baboon,
Buffalo, and other friends, were playing
one day at a certain game, there was a thunderstorm
and rain at Aroxaams. Lion and
Gurikhoisip began to quarrel. "I shall run to
the rain-field," said Lion. Gurikhoisip said
also, "I shall run to the rain-field." As
neither would concede this to the other, they
separated (angrily). After they had parted,
Lion went to tell his Mother those things which
they had both said.</p>

<p>His Mother said to him, "My son! that
Man whose head is in a line with his shoulders
and breast, who has pinching weapons, who
keeps white dogs, who goes about wearing the
tuft of a tiger's tail, beware of him!" Lion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
however, said, "Why need I be on my guard
against those whom I know?" Lioness answered,
"My Son, take care of him who
has pinching weapons!" But Lion would
not follow his Mother's advice, and the same
morning, when it was still pitch dark, he went
to Aroxaams, and laid himself in ambush.
Gurikhoisip went also that morning to the same
place. When he had arrived he let his dogs
drink, and then bathe. After they had finished
they wallowed. Then also Man drank; and,
when he had done drinking, Lion came out
of the bush. Dogs surrounded him as his
Mother had foretold, and he was speared by
Gurikhoisip. Just as he became aware that he
was speared, the Dogs drew him down again.
In this manner he grew faint. While he was in
this state, Gurikhoisip said to the Dogs, "Let
him alone now, that he may go and be taught
by his Mother." So the Dogs let him go. They
left him, and went home as he lay there. The
same night he walked towards home, but whilst
he was on the way his strength failed him, and
he lamented:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<blockquote><p>
"Mother! take me up!<br />
Grandmother! take me up! Oh me! Alas!"<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>At the dawn of day his Mother heard his
wailing, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"My Son, this is the thing which I have told
thee:</p>

<p>
"'Beware of the one who has pinching weapons,<br />
Who wears a tuft of tiger's tail,<br />
Of him who has white dogs!<br />
Alas! thou son of her who is short-eared,<br />
Thou, my short-eared child!<br />
Son of her who eats raw flesh,<br />
Thou flesh-devourer;<br />
Son of her whose nostrils are red from the prey,<br />
Thou with blood-stained nostrils!<br />
Son of her who drinks pit-water,<br />
Thou water-drinker!'"<br />

<h2>LION WHO TOOK A WOMAN'S<br />
SHAPE</h2>


<p>Some Women, it is said, went out to seek
roots and herbs and other wild food. On
their way home they sat down and said,
"Let us taste the food of the field." Now they
found that the food picked by one of them
was sweet, while that of the others was bitter.
The latter said to each other, "Look here! this
Woman's herbs are sweet." Then they said to
the owner of the sweet food, "Throw it away
and seek for other." So she threw away the
food, and went to gather more. When she had
collected a sufficient supply, she returned to
join the other Women, but could not find them.
She went therefore down to the river, where
Hare sat lading water, and said to him, "Hare,
give me some water that I may drink." But
he replied, "This is the cup out of which my
uncle (Lion) and I alone may drink."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>She asked again: "Hare, draw water for
me that I may drink." But Hare made the
same reply. Then she snatched the cup from
him and drank, but he ran home to tell his uncle
of the outrage which had been committed.</p>

<p>The Woman meanwhile replaced the cup and
went away. After she had departed Lion came
down, and, seeing her in the distance, pursued
her on the road. When she turned round
and saw him coming, she sang in the following
manner:</p>

<blockquote><p>
"My mother, she would not let me seek herbs,<br />
Herbs of the field, food from the field. Hoo!"<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>When Lion at last came up with the Woman,
they hunted each other round a shrub. She
wore many beads and arm-rings, and Lion said,
"Let me put them on!" So she lent them to
him, but he afterwards refused to return them
to her.</p>

<p>They then hunted each other again round
the shrub, till Lion fell down, and the Woman
jumped upon him, and kept him there. Lion
(uttering a form of conjuration) said:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<blockquote><p>
"My Aunt! it is morning, and time to rise;<br />
Pray, rise from me!"<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>She then rose from him, and they hunted
again after each other round the shrub, till the
Woman fell down, and Lion jumped upon her.
She then addressed him:</p>

<blockquote><p>
"My Uncle! it is morning, and time to rise;<br />
Pray, rise from me!"<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>He rose, of course, and they hunted each
other again, till Lion fell a second time. When
she jumped upon him he said:</p>

<blockquote><p>
"My Aunt! it is morning, and time to rise;<br />
Pray, rise from me!"<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>They rose again and hunted after each other.
The Woman at last fell down. But this time
when she repeated the above conjuration, Lion
said:</p>

<blockquote><p>"H&#232; Kha! Is it morning, and time to rise?"</p></blockquote>

<p>He then ate her, taking care, however, to
leave her skin whole, which he put on, together
with her dress and ornaments, so that he looked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
quite like a woman, and then went home to her
kraal.</p>

<p>When this counterfeit woman arrived, her little
sister, crying, said, "My sister, pour some
milk out for me." She answered, "I shall not
pour you out any." Then the Child addressed
their Mother: "Mama, do pour out some for
me." The Mother of the kraal said, "Go to
your sister, and let her give it to you!" The
little Child said again to her sister, "Please,
pour out for me!" She, however, repeated her
refusal, saying, "I will not do it." Then the
Mother of the kraal said to the little One,
"I refused to let her (the elder sister) seek
herbs in the field, and I do not know what may
have happened; go therefore to Hare, and ask
him to pour out for you."</p>

<p>So then Hare gave her some milk; but her
elder sister said, "Come and share it with me."
The little Child then went to her sister with her
bamboo (cup), and they both sucked the milk
out of it. Whilst they were doing this, some
milk was spilt on the little one's hand, and the
elder sister licked it up with her tongue, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
roughness of which drew blood; this, too, the
Woman licked up.</p>

<p>The little Child complained to her Mother:
"Mama, sister pricks holes in me and sucks the
blood." The Mother said, "With what Lion's
nature your sister went the way that I forbade
her, and returned, I do not know."</p>

<p>Now the Cows arrived, and the elder sister
cleansed the pails in order to milk them. But
when she approached the Cows with a thong
(in order to tie their fore-legs), they all refused
to be milked by her.</p>

<p>Hare said, "Why do not you stand before
the Cow?" She replied, "Hare, call your
brother, and do you two stand before the Cow."
Her husband said, "What has come over her
that the Cows refuse her? These are the same
Cows she always milks." The Mother (of the
kraal) said, "What has happened this evening?
These are Cows which she always milks without
assistance. What can have affected her that
she comes home as a woman with a Lion's nature?"</p>

<p>The elder daughter then said to her Mother,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
"I shall not milk the Cows." With these words
she sat down. The Mother said therefore to
Hare, "Bring me the bamboos, that I may milk.
I do not know what has come over the girl."</p>

<p>So the Mother herself milked the cows, and
when she had done so, Hare brought the bamboos
to the young wife's house, where her
husband was, but she (the wife) did not give
him (her husband) anything to eat. But when
at night time she fell asleep, they saw some of
the Lion's hair, which was hanging out where
he had slipped on the Woman's skin, and they
cried, "Verily! this is quite another being. It
is for this reason that the Cows refused to be
milked."</p>

<p>Then the people of the kraal began to break
up the hut in which Lion lay asleep. When
they took off the mats, they said (conjuring
them), "If thou art favourably inclined to me,
O Mat, give the sound 'sawa'" (meaning, making
no noise).</p>

<p>To the poles (on which the hut rested) they
said, "If thou art favourably inclined to me,
O Pole, thou must give the sound 'gara.'"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>They addressed also the bamboos and the bed-skins
in a similar manner.</p>

<p>Thus gradually and noiselessly they removed
the hut and all its contents. Then they took
bunches of grass, put them over the Lion, and
lighting them, said, "If thou art favourably inclined
to me, O Fire, thou must flare up, 'boo
boo,' before thou comest to the heart."</p>

<p>So the Fire flared up when it came towards
the heart, and the heart of the Woman jumped
upon the ground. The Mother (of the kraal)
picked it up, and put it into a calabash.</p>

<p>Lion, from his place in the fire, said to the
Mother (of the kraal), "How nicely I have
eaten your daughter." The Woman answered,
"You have also now a comfortable place!"</p>

<p>Now the Woman took the first milk of as
many Cows as had calves, and put it into the
calabash where her daughter's heart was; the
calabash increased in size, and in proportion to
this the girl grew again inside it.</p>

<p>One day, when the Mother (of the kraal)
went out to fetch wood, she said to Hare,
"By the time that I come back you must have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
everything nice and clean." But during her
Mother's absence, the girl crept out of the calabash,
and put the hut in good order, as she
had been used to do in former days, and said
to Hare, "When Mother comes back and asks,
'Who has done these things?' you must say,
'I, Hare, did them.'" After she had done all,
she hid herself on the stage.</p>

<p>When the Mother of the kraal came home,
she said, "Hare, who has done these things?
They look just as they used when my daughter
did them." Hare said, "I did the things."
But the Mother would not believe it, and looked
at the calabash. Seeing it was empty, she
searched the stage and found her daughter.
Then she embraced and kissed her, and from
that day the girl stayed with her Mother, and
did everything as she was wont in former times;
but she now remained unmarried.</p>

<h2>WHY HAS JACKAL A LONG<br />
BLACK STRIPE ON HIS<br />
BACK?</h2>


<p>The Sun, it is said, was one day on earth,
and the men who were travelling saw
him sitting by the wayside, but passed
him without notice. Jackal, however, who came
after them, and saw him also sitting, went to
him and said, "Such a fine little child is left
behind by the men." He then took Sun up,
and put it into his awa-skin (on his back).
When it burnt him, he said, "Get down," and
shook himself; but Sun stuck fast to his back,
and burnt Jackal's back black from that day.</p>

<h2>HORSE CURSED BY SUN</h2>


<p>It is said that once Sun was on earth, and
caught Horse to ride it. But it was unable
to bear his weight, and therefore Ox
took the place of Horse, and carried Sun on its
back. Since that time Horse is cursed in these
words, because it could not carry Sun's weight:</p>

<blockquote><p>
"From to-day thou shalt have a (certain) time of dying.<br />
This is thy curse, that thou hast a (certain) time of dying.<br />
And day and night shalt thou eat,<br />
But the desire of thy heart shall not be at rest,<br />
Though thou grazest till morning and again until sunset.<br />
Behold, this is the judgment which I pass upon thee," said Sun.<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>Since that day Horse's (certain) time of
dying commenced.</p>

<h2>LION'S DEFEAT</h2>


<p>The wild animals, it is said, were once
assembled at Lion's. When Lion was
asleep, Jackal persuaded Little Fox to
twist a rope of ostrich sinews, in order to
play Lion a trick. They took ostrich sinews,
twisted them, and fastened the rope to Lion's
tail, and the other end of the rope they tied
to a shrub. When Lion awoke, and saw that
he was tied up, he became angry, and called
the animals together. When they had assembled,
Lion said (using this form of conjuration)&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"What child of his mother and father's love,<br />
Whose mother and father's love has tied me?"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then answered the animal to whom the question
was first put&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<blockquote><p>"I, child of my mother and father's love,<br />
I, mother and father's love, I have not done it."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All answered the same; but when he asked
Little Fox, Little Fox said&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"I, child of my mother and father's love,<br />
I, mother and father's love, have tied thee!"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then Lion tore the rope made of sinews, and
ran after Little Fox. But Jackal said:</p>

<blockquote><p>"My boy, thou son of lean Mrs. Fox, thou
wilt never be caught."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Truly Lion was thus beaten in running by
Little Fox.</p>

<h2>THE ORIGIN OF DEATH</h2>


<p>The Moon, it is said, sent once an Insect
to Men, saying, "Go thou to Men, and
tell them, 'As I die, and dying live, so
ye shall also die, and dying live.'" The Insect
started with the message, but whilst on his way
was overtaken by the Hare, who asked: "On
what errand art thou bound?" The Insect answered:
"I am sent by the Moon to Men, to
tell them that as she dies, and dying lives, they
also shall die, and dying live." The Hare said,
"As thou art an awkward runner, let me go"
(to take the message). With these words he
ran off, and when he reached Men, he said,
"I am sent by the Moon to tell you, 'As I
die, and dying perish, in the same manner ye
shall also die and come wholly to an end.'"
Then the Hare returned to the Moon, and told
her what he had said to Men. The Moon
reproached him angrily, saying, "Darest thou<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
tell the people a thing which I have not said?"
With these words she took up a piece of wood,
and struck him on the nose. Since that day
the Hare's nose is slit.</p>

<h2>ANOTHER VERSION OF THE<br />
SAME FABLE</h2>


<p>The Moon dies, and rises to life again.
The Moon said to the Hare, "Go thou
to Men, and tell them, 'Like as I die
and rise to life again, so you also shall die and
rise to life again.'" The Hare went to the Men,
and said, "Like as I die and do not rise to life
again, so you shall also die, and not rise to life
again." When he returned the Moon asked
"What hast thou said?" "I have told them,
'Like as I die and do not rise to life again, so
you shall also die and not rise to life again.'"
"What," said the Moon, "hast thou said
that?" And she took a stick and beat the Hare
on his mouth, which was slit by the blow. The
Hare fled, and is still fleeing.</p>

<h2>A THIRD VERSION OF THE<br />
SAME FABLE</h2>


<p>The Moon, on one occasion, sent the
Hare to the earth to inform Men that
as she (the Moon) died away and rose
again, so mankind should die and rise again.
Instead, however, of delivering this message as
given, the Hare, either out of forgetfulness or
malice, told mankind that as the Moon rose and
died away, so Man should die and rise no more.
The Hare, having returned to the Moon, was
questioned as to the message delivered, and the
Moon, having heard the true state of the case,
became so enraged with him that she took up a
hatchet to split his head; falling short, however,
of that, the hatchet fell upon the upper lip of
the Hare, and cut it severely. Hence it is that
we see the "Hare-lip." The Hare, being
duly incensed at having received such treatment,
raised his claws, and scratched the Moon's face;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
and the dark spots which we now see on the
surface of the Moon are the scars which she
received on that occasion.</p>

<h2>A FOURTH VERSION OF THE<br />
SAME FABLE</h2>


<p>The Moon, they say, wished to send a
message to Men, and the Hare said that
he would take it. "Run, then," said the
Moon, "and tell Men that as I die and am renewed,
so shall they also be renewed." But the
Hare deceived Men, and said, "As I die and

<h2>A ZULU VERSION OF THE LEGEND<br />
OF THE "ORIGIN OF<br />
DEATH"</h2>


<p>God (Unknlunkuln) arose from beneath
(the seat of the spiritual world, according
to the Zulu idea), and created
in the beginning men, animals, and all things.
He then sent for the Chameleon, and said, "Go,
Chameleon, and tell Men that they shall not
die." The Chameleon went, but it walked
slowly, and loitered on the way, eating of a shrub
called Bukwebezane.</p>

<p>When it had been away some time, God sent
the Salamander after it, ordering him to make
haste and tell Men that they should die. The
Salamander went on his way with this message,
outran the Chameleon, and, arriving first where
the Men were, told them that they must die.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
